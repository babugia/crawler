However, when this happens, mortality is high due to delayed diagnosis and/or inadequate treatment.CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old white man was referred to neurosurgery due to a non-functional pituitary macroadenoma. He underwent a partial resection of the tumor on July 2, 2015. On the day following surgery he presented polyuria with sodium 149 mEq/L, plasma osmolality 301 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality 293 mOsm/kg. He started nasal desmopressin 0.05 mg/day with good response. He was already on dexamethasone 4 mg and levothyroxine 75 mcg due to hypopituitarism after surgery. On July 9 he became confused. Cerebral computed tomography was performed with no significant changes. His natremia dropped to 128 mEq/L with development of polyuria despite maintenance of desmopressin dose. His hemoglobin and hematocrit rose from 9.1 g/L to 11.6 g/L and 27.5 to 32.5, respectively. His thyroid function was normal and he was on hydrocortisone 30 mg/day. At 12 p.m. 150 mg/hydrocortisone infusion was initiated, but sodium did not increase. Plasma and urine osmolality were 264 mOsm/kg and 679 mOsm/kg, respectively. At 4 p.m. hydrocortisone was increased and hypertonic saline replacement started. Two hours later he was dehydrated with polyuria and vomiting, and natremia of 124 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was very resistant to treatment despite hypertonic saline replacement, hence desmopressin was suspended. The following day, urine spot analysis showed that natriuresis was 63 mEq/L with serum sodium 132 mEq/L. This was interpreted as a cerebral salt wasting syndrome and control was achieved with aggressive hypertonic saline replacements and fludrocortisone 0.1 mg/three times a day.CONCLUSION: We present a rare case of a patient with diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting syndrome, who was successfully treated. Hyponatremia in a patient with diabetes insipidus may erroneously be interpreted as inadequate diabetes insipidus control or as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, leading to therapeutic errors. Thus, all clinical and analytical data should be evaluated together for early and correct diagnosis.;INTRODUCTION: Fluid and electrolytes disorders are not rare in patients after brain surgery, especially in surgery that involves the pituitary gland. Hyponatremia can occur in 8 to 35% of patients following pituitary surgery [1, 2].There are a lot of causes for water and electrolytic disturbances and, among them, transient diabetes insipidus (DI) has been found to be the most common followed by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS), and transient hyponatremia [3–5]. DI is defined as the concomitant presence of inappropriate hypotonic polyuria, which is urine output > 3 L/24 hours and urine osmolality (uOsm) < 300 mOsm/kg, in the presence of high or normal serum sodium (Na) due to decreased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to the inability to concentrate the urine and subsequent excretion of large volumes of dilute urine [6]. Rarely, after surgery, patients may exhibit a pattern known as triphasic DI: an early polyuric phase, within 24 to 48 hours after surgery, an antidiuretic phase due to an uncontrolled release of vasopressin, usually 5 to 8 days after surgery, which can produce hyponatremia and SIADH, and a final polyuric phase which is often permanent [7].CSWS is defined as renal loss of Na during intracranial disorders leading to hyponatremia and a decrease in extracellular fluid volume. It is a rare and alarming condition, which is predominantly associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, but can also occur after head injury, neurosurgery, intracranial neoplasm, or cerebral infection [4, 8]. It was first described in 1950 as an explanation for the natriuresis and hyponatremia that sometimes is associated with cerebral disease [9]. The incidence of CSWS is unclear, the condition is characterized by hyponatremia caused by primary renal salt loss and subsequent polyuria, natriuresis, and hypovolemia. The mechanism underlying CSWS is unclear, but may involve increased levels of circulating natriuretic factors, together with decreased sympathetic input to the kidney. These factors increase urinary Na excretion and diminish effective arterial blood volume, which stimulates baroreceptors on ADH release. Unlike SIADH, ADH release in CSWS is an adequate response to volume depletion. Among patients with central nervous system (CNS) disease, CSWS is a much less common cause of hyponatremia than SIADH [3, 5, 10–12].DI and CSWS rarely occur simultaneously. There are only a few cases described in the literature of this combination, with a high mortality or vegetative state associated with them [8, 13, 14]. This unfavorable prognosis occurs due to frequent misdiagnosis or incorrect Na correction, thus representing a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.We present a rare case of a patient with DI and CSWS who was successfully treated, and we also review the literature regarding this combination.CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old white man was referred to neurosurgery due to a non-functional pituitary macroadenoma with bitemporal hemianopsia associated. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a large sellar and suprasellar mass with invasion of cavernous sinuses bilaterally and with superior stretching and bulging of the optic chiasm (Fig. 1). His past medical history included depression, but he was not medicated for this.                                      Fig. 1                      Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging. T1-weighted coronal view (a) and sagittal view (b) post-gadolinium showing a large macroadenomaHe was admitted to our neurosurgery department and underwent partial resection of the tumor by subfrontal approach on July 2, 2015. The tumor was large, but the surgery was no more invasive than the usual pituitary surgery, and there was no section of the pituitary gland.On the first postoperative day, he presented polyuria of 200 mL/hour with Na 149 mEq/L, plasma osmolality (pOsm) 301 mOsm/kg, uOsm 293 mOsm/kg, and complained of being thirsty. He was receiving an intravenous infusion of 150 mg of hydrocortisone, dexamethasone 4 mg every 8 hours over 24 hours, 1500 ml of intravenously administered isotonic saline, and free water ingestion (Table 1). His plasma glucose levels were between 113 and 138 mg/dL, and his spot analysis did not show glycosuria. His condition was interpreted as DI, and he started nasal desmopressin 0.05 mg/day with good response. On July 5 his Na was 142 mEq/L with resolved polyuria.Table 1                      Data of the patient regarding diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting syndrome                    Postoperative day01367891112 Day of surgeryDICSWSNa plasma (mEq/L)145149142137128129132138145Na urine (mEq/L)      63  pOsm (mOsm/Kg) 301293 264293276290297uOsm (mOsm/kg) 293 495679 367312167Diuresis   25004320    Urine density    1015  1008 Hb (g/dL)10.910.99.1 11.610.4  10.1Hematocrit (%)31.132.727.5 32.528.8  29.3NaCl 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 1000 mL ––83 mL/h42 mL/h42 mL/h42 mL/h42 mL/h42 mL/hHypertonic saline – NaCl 200 mg/mL (20%) diluted in fluid therapy––––×3×3×6×6×4Desmopressin (mg) Nasal 0.05 mg/day  Stop   Started 0.03 mg/dayFludrocortisone     0.1 mg tid                       CSWS cerebral salt wasting syndrome, DI diabetes insipidus, Hb hemoglobin, Na sodium, NaCl sodium chloride, pOsm plasma osmolality, tid three times a day, uOsm urine osmolalityOn the sixth postoperative day he was transferred to our neurosurgery ward, and medicated with desmopressin 0.05/day, levothyroxine 75 μg, hydrocortisone 30 mg/day, and 1000 mL of isotonic fluid. He was started on levothyroxine because his blood tests after surgery revealed hypopituitarism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.08 uUI/mL, Free T4 1.23 ng/dL (0.7–1.48), free testosterone 1.47 pg/mL (7.20–23), plasma cortisol 0.80 μg/dL, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) < 1.0 ng/dL.On the seventh postoperative day, he became confused and complained of headache. A cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan was performed with no significant changes. His blood tests showed that natremia dropped from 137 mEq/L to 128 mEq/l, with development of polyuria of 4320 mL/day, despite the maintenance of desmopressin dose. His hemoglobin and hematocrit rose from 9.1 g/L to 11.6 g/L and 27.5% to 32.5% (reference value 43–55), respectively. His thyroid function was normal, and he had taken the prescribed hydrocortisone dose. His plasma glucose level was 89 mg/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 28 mg/dL, creatinine 0.51 mg/dL, potassium 3.7 mEq/L, and chloride 93 mEq/L. At 12 p.m. he initiated 150 mg of hydrocortisone infusion, but his Na level did not increase. Plasma and uOsm were 264 mOsm/kg and 679 mOsm/kg, respectively. At 4 p.m. hydrocortisone infusion was increased to 200 mg in 500 mL of sodium chloride (NaCl) 9 mg/mL (0.9%), and hypertonic saline replacements were started with infusion of hypertonic Na over 20 minutes. Desmopressin was removed from the prescription. Despite these medications his natremia dropped even more, to 124 mEq/L. The hydrocortisone infusion was replaced with intravenously administered hydrocortisone 50 mg four times a day, and another infusion of hypertonic Na was performed. In the evening his Na was 123 mEq/L and he was dehydrated, with reduced turgor, dried oral mucosa, persistent polyuria and vomiting, normal heart rate, and blood pressure of 96/58 mmHg. Hyponatremia was very resistant to treatment despite hypertonic saline replacements, without improvements of serum Na levels. We opted to start a continued infusion of three ampoules of 20% hypertonic saline diluted in 1000 mL of isotonic saline with an infusion rate of 42 mL/hour, and he was transferred to an intermediate care unit for proper surveillance. Given this clinical picture, the association of DI and CSWS was considered. On the ninth postoperative day, urine spot analysis showed that natriuresis was 63 mEq/L, even in the face of decreased serum Na of 132 mEq/L, representing another clue to the confirmation of the CSWS diagnosis.On the eight postoperative day our patient’s Na was 129 mEq/L, and we started fludrocortisone 0.1 mg/three times a day because it is a known effective adjunct treatment of CSWS. His Na increased to 132 on the following day. As an adverse effect of fludrocortisone, he developed hypokalemia, which we controlled with potassium supplements.Over the following days, his Na level was stabilized and desmopressin was restarted. His urine volume subsequently decreased to a normal diuresis. He was managed with intravenously administered fluids and hypertonic saline. The hypertonic saline dose was gradually decreased and switched to NaCl tablets.He was discharged on postoperative day 27, medicated with fludrocortisone 0.1 mg/twice a day, orally administered NaCl 16 g/day, orally administered desmopressin 0.1 mg/twice a day, hydrocortisone 20 mg/day, levothyroxine 100 mg/day, and potassium chloride supplements. On follow-up as an out-patient, fludrocortisone and potassium were reduced and then discontinued. Two months later he was only taking hydrocortisone, desmopressin, and levothyroxine, and testosterone replacement was prescribed. The dose of desmopressin had to be increased to 0.5 mg/day to control diuresis, which indicated persistent DI in our patient.Regarding the adenoma, the histological result was revealed to be a gonadotropinoma. He underwent another neurosurgery on February 4, 2016, he also underwent external radiotherapy with a total dose of 52.2 Gy in 29 fractions and with photon energy of 18 MV, according to the computerized dosimetry planning. He is now clinically well, with his hypopituitarism and permanent DI controlled.DISCUSSION: This case describes a patient with a rare combination of two diseases involving different electrolyte disturbances. DI typically occurs as early as several hours after brain surgery, usually within the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery, as was the case in this patient [13, 15]. Diagnosis is made based on clinical and biochemical results, which include sudden onset of polyuria, polydipsia, high serum Na, high pOsm, low uOsm, and low urine specific gravity. In cases of high urine output it is also important to rule out glycosuria and hyperglycemia, especially if the patient is on steroids, and to check if intraoperative fluid overload could have contributed to polyuria [1, 15]. However, in these cases, the low level of Na is an artifact in the presence of hyperglycemia and glycosuria, and typically natremia is normal or low and there is no increase in thirst with fluids overload [5]. This patient was on dexamethasone 4 mg/day, but his glycaemia was in the normal range and he was not suffering from fluid overload.There are several risk factors for the development of DI, namely: being of young age, being male, and having larger sellar tumors (as this patient had), intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula, Rathke’s cysts, or craniopharyngioma [5]. The treatment of this condition is relatively easy with desmopressin. However, this treatment should be monitored to assess whether the desmopressin dosage is correct to achieve a normal Na value and to prevent overdose and subsequent hyponatremia.When the hyponatremia of this patient began he was on desmopressin, but he developed profound polyuria, which indicates that an excessive dose of desmopressin was not the cause. In cases of desmopressin deficiency, hypernatremia is seen with polyuria, as occurred on the first day after surgery with this patient.One study has reported that, very often, the cause of hyponatremia is not clear [16]. This patient initially had moderately severe symptoms of hyponatremia, but then developed severe symptoms, with his hyponatremia worsening from 128 mEq/L, moderate hyponatremia, to 124 mEq/L, profound hyponatremia. There are many potential causes of hyponatremia after pituitary surgery: hypertonic fluid overload during surgery, SIADH by posterior lobe lesion, CSWS, secondary adrenal insufficiency, central hypothyroidism, desmopressin intoxication, hyperglycemia, and drugs. However, there are some clues that should be considered in order to make a diagnosis. Iatrogenic overload of hypotonic fluids and secondary adrenal insufficiency are more common in the first few days after surgery, while SIADH and CSWS occur typically 1 week after surgery or later. SIADH and hypothyroidism are associated with euvolemia, and CSWS is associated with hypovolemia [5, 12]. This patient was on 30 mg/day hydrocortisone and 75 μg/day levothyroxine with a normal thyroxine value, so it was unlikely that adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism were causing hyponatremia. Despite that, hydrocortisone was increased and Na continued to decrease and hypothyroidism very rarely causes hyponatremia, even though it is mentioned in many diagnostic algorithms [12].CSWS usually occurs in the first week after subarachnoid hemorrhage, trauma, stroke, or brain surgery, and resolves spontaneously after 3 to 4 weeks. In rare cases it can be long-standing and can last for months, especially in the presence of CNS infection, cerebrospinal fluid obstruction, and tumor progression. A diagnosis of CSWS has to be considered in the presence of hyponatremia, an inappropriately elevated uOsm, high urine volume, urine Na concentration greater that 30 mEq/L, low serum uric acid concentration due to urate wasting in the urine, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, poor skin turgor, and low central venous pressure [12, 17]. It is not rare to see an increase in hematocrit and urea levels, which indicate dehydration. The most important criterion to differentiate CSWS from SIADH is extracellular fluid volume status, which is increased in SIADH and decreased in CSWS. Weight is increased or unchanged in SIADH, and decreased in CSWS, serum osmolality is decreased in SIADH and increased or normal in CSWS, serum protein levels are normal or high in CSWS, and hematocrit is low or normal in SIADH and increased in CSWS [7]. An appropriate examination is crucial for correct diagnosis, and it is important to remember that there are some laboratory findings that are seen in SIADH and sometimes the patient has milder hypovolemia, in which case it is challenging to distinguish this from SIADH [15, 17]. In the case of this patient this doubt did not exist, as he developed an obvious clinical condition of hypovolemia and dehydration. Unfortunately, we do not have information regarding the weight of our patient nor his water balance when he developed CSWS because he was on a neurosurgery ward at the time.According to several recommendations or guidelines, in the presence of acute hyponatremia hypertonic saline solution should be administered, as we did [7, 12]. Moreover, the distinction between CSWS and SIADH is critically important since the two disorders are managed differently, with potential mortal effects if the incorrect strategy is administered. Treatment of CSWS involves water and salt supplementation since volume repletion will suppress the release of ADH, resulting in dilute urine and correction of hyponatremia. In the presence of SIADH, isotonic saline often worsens the hyponatremia as the salt is excreted and some of the water is retained, so the treatment must be fluid restriction. Mineralocorticoid administration, fludrocortisone 0.2–0.4 mg/day, is often indicated for the treatment of SIADH. This drug mediates a return to normal Na values via a reduction in natriuresis by increasing Na reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule [1, 15, 18]. Hypokalemia is a common adverse effect, but it can be managed by adding potassium supplements, as we did [15]. It is not known when the ideal time to start fludrocortisone is, but some authors suggest that it should be started after several days when the diagnosis is not clear, when management by replacement of salt/fluids is not sufficient, or when it is causing practical difficulties [18].When CSWS coexists with DI, polyuria secondary to natriuresis should not be considered a sign of poorly controlled DI [1, 15]. In DI, hypernatremia is characteristic, whereas in CSWS natremia typically decreases and an increase of the desmopressin dose may worsen hyponatremia [15, 19]. We opted to stop desmopressin for 5 days, but some authors have reported keeping desmopressin therapeutic with careful surveillance of fluid and natremia status [13].There are only a few reports described in the literature of this combination of diagnoses in the same patient, and this association is linked to very high mortality [8, 13, 14].In a review of 16 children with DI plus CSWS, only three patients survived in a vegetative state. In another study of 54 children with DI, 16 developed CSWS and only two of these survived, also in a vegetative state. In these two reviews, the most common etiology was CNS infection, and none had pituitary surgery as the cause [8, 14].The last published review regarding patients with this combination of diseases included 11 patients, mostly adults, with traumatic brain injuries caused by traffic accidents or falls. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage was the major cause of this association, and only five patients had a good prognosis. The authors noted that the fact that serum Na levels might be normal in combined DI and CSWS can contribute to a late diagnosis. Incorrect diagnosis and treatment strategy are likely to be responsible for these terrible results [13].None of the previous reviews included patients for whom transsphenoidal surgery was the cause of the combination of diseases, and we found no previous case reports of this combination after transsphenoidal surgery.In conclusion, the management of fluid and electrolyte disorders after brain surgery is challenging. DI and CSWS can occur in the same patient after pituitary surgery, and clinicians should be aware of this possibility. This case report highlights the importance of regularly reviewing the patient’s clinical situation, hydration status, urine output, and Na balance. This combination of conditions should be kept in mind in the postoperative period of cranial tumors, because a prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy are necessary for a good outcome.This is the first described case report in the literature of CSWS and DI after pituitary adenoma surgery with an unusual good outcome.CONCLUSION:;

The presence of purpura facilitates the diagnosis of Henoch–Schönlein purpura at the onset of associated symptoms, whereas the absence of purpura makes the diagnosis challenging. It is important to diagnose Henoch–Schönlein purpura with delayed-onset skin purpura to avoid unnecessary surgery for acute abdomen. Most cases of Henoch–Schönlein purpura with severe abdominal pain are treated with low-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin.CASE PRESENTATION: A 15-year-old Korean girl complained of severe abdominal pain and delayed-onset purpura on admission. Henoch–Schönlein purpura was diagnosed based on endoscopic findings of hemorrhagic duodenitis and duodenal vasculitis and abdominal computed tomography findings of edematous bowels. Two common initial treatments, a low-dose steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin, were administered, but there was no improvement for 1 month. Subsequently, we used high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 1g/day), which dramatically alleviated her abdominal symptoms.CONCLUSION: High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy can be used as the ultimate treatment for delayed-onset Henoch–Schönlein purpura with severe abdominal pain when symptoms do not improve after low-dose steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin treatments.;INTRODUCTION: Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP) is one of the most common small vascular inflammatory diseases in childhood that is associated with an immunoglobulin (Ig) A-mediated autoimmune response [1]. The main clinical symptoms of HSP, including purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and nephritis [2], which are associated with vascular injuries of the skin, joint areas, abdomen, and kidneys, do not always occur simultaneously [3]. HSP can be characterized by palpable purpura mostly over the buttocks and lower extremities. Compared to other clinical manifestations, palpable purpura is present in all patients with HSP [2]. HSP can be diagnosed if palpable purpura is present with diffuse abdominal pain, any biopsy showing predominant IgA deposition, arthritis, arthralgia, or renal involvement [2]. Therefore, it may be difficult to diagnose HSP based only on associated symptoms if palpable purpura is momentarily absent.Intravenous Ig (IVIg) and low-dose steroids have been used for treating HSP with gastrointestinal (GI) involvement [4,5]. When HSP with GI involvement is diagnosed, a low-dose steroid (1 to 2mg/kg/day) can be administered initially, followed by IVIg if the symptoms persist [4]. When purpura is present, the response to these treatments is favorable, except in cases of HSP with delayed-onset purpura [6]. Here we describe a case of delayed-onset purpura with GI involvement in which high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (IMPT) was effective.CASE PRESENTATION: In July 2013, a previously healthy 15-year-old Korean girl presented with abdominal pain and bile-colored vomiting, which began 6 days prior. She had poor food intake since the onset of symptoms. Her urine output started decreasing daily before hospital transfer. She lost approximately 6kg in a week (from 46kg to 40kg). There was no sign of purpura. Her blood pressure (BP) was high (130/90mmHg), heart rate was 114 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute, and temperature was 37.5°C. However, laboratory and urine analysis results indicated no significant abnormalities, except 1+ proteinuria due to dehydration. On hospital day (HD) 1, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and diffuse superficial ulceration with whitish membrane and mucosal bleeding was noted in the descending and transverse portion of her duodenum (Figure 1). A purplish and reddish mucosal edema was also noted, indicating hemorrhagic duodenitis and duodenal vasculitis due to HSP. IMPT (60mg/day, 1mg/kg/day to a maximum of 60 to 80mg/day) and intravenous pantoprazole/ranitidine (gastric acid pump inhibiter/H2-blocker) were administered because of difficulties with oral intake. Intravenous pethidine and morphine were used for pain control but were ineffective.                                      Figure 1                      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy of the Henoch–Schönlein purpura-affected bowel. A) the antrum of the stomach and B) the duodenal second portion. This image shows the descending and transverse portion of the duodenum in the patient with hemorrhagic duodenitis and duodenal vasculitis with the additional finding of a purplish and reddish mucosal edema.On HD 4, a second EGD was performed because of worsening abdominal pain. The previous lesion had slightly improved. However, diffuse superficial ulceration with edematous and dark brownish mucosa was noted in the descending and transverse portions of her duodenum. Under the presumptive diagnosis of duodenal vasculitis caused by HSP, high-dose IVIg was administered (2g/kg/day).On HD 7, she experienced dyspnea and persistent abdominal pain. She had an acutely ill appearance. Her BP and temperature increased to 140/80mmHg and 38.3°C, respectively. Her serum was negative for antinuclear antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Serum complements 3 and 4 (132mg/dL and 16mg/dL, respectively) were within normal limits. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were 3629mg/dL (normal range, 639 to 1349mg/dL), 162mg/dL (normal range, 70 to 312mg/dL), and 139mg/dL (normal range, 56 to 352mg/dL), respectively. Urine analysis revealed microscopic hematuria. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed an edematous bowel (Figure 2). Intravenous cefotaxime was added because of her persistent high fever and inflammation. IMPT (60mg/day) was discontinued because of pancreatitis.                                      Figure 2                      Computed tomography of the abdomen showing an edematous bowel. This image shows multifocal areas of bowel wall thickening, mesenteric edema, and vascular engorgement in jejuno-ileal loops (yellow arrows).On HD 11, purpura developed on both of her ankles and feet (Figure 3). Her temperature was still high (38.2°C). A laboratory examination still showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC, 22,200/μL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 64mm/hour). Her amylase, lipase, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increased to 190IU/L, 210U/L, and 17.14mg/dL, respectively. Since pancreatitis had not improved after discontinuing IMPT, we readministered low-dose IMPT (0.5mg/kg/day).                                      Figure 3                                              Palpable purpura on both of the patient’s ankles and feet on hospital day 11.On HD 14, her abdominal pain was aggravated, but the purpura disappeared. She still had a fever (38.0°C). Her laboratory results showed a much higher WBC (34,700/μL) and a declined but abnormal ESR (15mm/hour) and amylase (74IU/L), lipase (62U/L), and CRP (8.16mg/dL) levels. However, her random urine protein to creatinine ratio (UP/Cr) value of 0.41 had slightly increased. Because of her aggravated abdominal pain, an emergency abdominal CT scan was performed, showing more severe bowel edema. Consequently, the IMPT dose was increased to 1 to 2mg/kg/day, with the addition of intravenous metronidazole. On HD 17, the second IVIg was infused (2g/kg).On HD 20, her fever and abdominal pain persisted, and gross hematuria (GHU) developed. Laboratory results showed the following abnormalities: WBC count, 23,600/μL, ESR, 67mm/hour, amylase, 125IU/dL, lipase, 104U/L, and CRP, 6.41mg/dL. The random UP/Cr had elevated to 2.15. The antibiotic was switched to piperacillin and tazobactam to eradicate the infection. A kidney biopsy was performed. Finally, a decision was made to administer high-dose IMPT for 3 days consecutively. The renal biopsy showed an increased glomerulus size, segment hypercellularity, 9% segmental loop necrosis on light microscopy, mesangial deposits on electron microscopy, and IgA 3+ on immunofluorescence microscopy. Overall, the biopsy revealed grade II HSP nephritis according to the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children grading system [7], and HSP nephritis was confirmed (Figure 4).

D) The mesangial deposit is observed on electron microscopy. E) The immunoglobulin A deposit is 3+ on immunofluorescence microscopy. Overall, grade II Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis is diagnosed based on the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children grading system [7].After the course of high-dose IMPT, her abdominal pain and fever dramatically disappeared. On HD 30, an oral, not intravenous, steroid (1mg/kg/day to a maximum of 60 to 80mg/day) was administered, because the patient was able to eat. GHU and proteinuria persisted. Therefore, enalapril was prescribed for the proteinuria (5mg daily), and she was discharged. The oral steroid was discontinued after 6 months, and only enalapril was continued for an additional 2 months. Urine analysis results at the last follow-up in April 2014 were as follows: proteins, negative, red blood cells, 1 to 4/high-power field, and UP/Cr, 0.047.DISCUSSION: The patient was admitted to our hospital with upper abdominal pain and bile-color vomiting. On admission, there was no evidence of intestinal obstruction or acute pancreatitis during the initial physical examination or on radiographs. Therefore, EGD was performed to determine if a gastric ulcer such as HSP duodenitis was present. Based on the EGD findings, duodenal vasculitis due to HSP was diagnosed. It is not rare for a patient with HSP to present with skin purpura prior to having abdominal symptoms. However, in our case, HSP was associated with delayed-onset purpura and GI involvement at disease onset. Approximately 14 to 36% of cases of HSP show GI involvement with delayed-onset of purpura [3]. Therefore, if a patient complains of severe upper epigastric pain, duodenitis due to HSP must be considered even though skin purpura may be absent.Treatment for HSP is controversial. Although in some cases the symptoms may resolve without any therapy, corticosteroids and IVIg have been used in patients with HSP with severe GI involvement as standard and alternative therapy, respectively [4,5]. In this case, the patient complained of repeated severe abdominal pain accompanied by abdominal distention, dyspnea, fever, and pancreatitis. The symptoms did not resolve even after administering twice the amount of low-dose steroid treatments, followed by twice the amount of IVIg injections. Severe edema of her small intestine was also observed on CT. The efficacy of double IVIg injections in most cases of refractory intestinal involvement by HSP is unknown, however, it did not work in our case.IMPT may aggravate pancreatitis. However, serial changes of amylase/lipase worsened even after discontinuing the steroid. Thus, pancreatitis was not induced by IMPT. Furthermore, in most cases, HSP would be accompanied by pancreatitis. We considered that pancreatitis was a complication of uncontrolled HSP.Studies have reported that high-dose IMPT is rarely used to stop the progression of nephropathy in cases of HSP nephritis with a severe crescent on renal biopsy [8]. However, a few case reports have suggested high-dose IMPT for HSP with GI involvement [6]. In this case, renal biopsy was performed because of the GHU on HD 20. Even though the biopsy showed that renal involvement was not as serious as assumed by the severe abdominal symptoms, high-dose IMPT was performed because the two standard treatments failed. After administering high-dose IMPT, her fever continued for 2 weeks while severe abdominal pain and whole body discomfort disappeared. Since she was able to eat independently, intravenous nutrition was discontinued. Therefore, all of the abdominal symptoms recovered simultaneously with high-dose IMPT.In our case, a high serum level of IgG was noted. However, it was assumed that this elevation was because IVIg was the previous initial treatment.Besides, it is more important to recognize that severe abdominal symptoms (bloody stool) and persistent purpura for >1 month are risk factors for renal involvement [9]. In this case, GI symptoms were severe, with less involvement of the kidneys. When GI symptoms are severe, the possibility of another disease (for example, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, microscopic polyangiitis, or Wegener’s granulomatosis), which are capable of mimicking HSP, should be ruled out [10-13].A low level of factor XIII activity correlates with the severity of HSP’s clinical manifestations, particularly abdominal pain and GI bleeding [14,15]. In our case, we could not quantitatively determine the factor XIII level. One study suggested that the administration of factor XIII may be useful in the rapid improvement of severe abdominal pain and GI bleeding [15].CONCLUSION:High-dose IMPT can be used as the ultimate treatment for delayed-onset HSP with severe abdominal pain when symptoms do not improve after administering low-dose steroid and IVIg treatments.;

The deficiency in ADAMTS13 metalloprotease, which cleaves the von Willebrand factor, may be congenital or acquired. The congenital form is caused by inherited mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. The diagnosis is challenging due to the nonspecific signs and symptoms, as well as the rarity of the disease.CASE PRESENTATION: We present an unusual case of a 20-year-old feoderm woman from northeast region of Brazil who manifested thrombocytopenia during her pregnancy which was believed to be immune thrombocytopenic purpura.CONCLUSION: Considering the importance of a differential diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathic disorders, congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may mimic the signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, hemolysis with elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome, and atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. It should be considered in suspect cases in patients with an ADAMTS13 activity at 5% without ADAMTS13 antibodies.;INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a serious condition resulting from platelet aggregation mainly at a microcirculation level. It results in thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and occlusive ischemia [1]. The occlusion is caused by widespread microthrombi composed basically of platelets and von Willebrand factor (vWF). The target organ of this occlusive ischemia process is mainly the brain. The kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract are less often affected. During the disease, protein deficiency promotes the formation of abnormally large von-Willebrand multimers, attracting platelets and fibrin anchors and creating a widespread prothrombotic feedback process with a systemic deposition of platelet thrombi on capillary vessels and arteries. The disease usually results from a reduction in the activity of the enzyme ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease responsible for vWF cleavage [2]. This reduction is due to the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies (acquired TTP) or ADAMTS13 gene mutation (inherited TTP).Acquired TTP is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy with an incidence of approximately 2.2 cases per million per year [3]. Congenital or inherited TTP represents less than 5% of all cases of TTP and the annual incidence is estimated at less than 1/1,000,000 [4]. Neonates and children usually manifest congenital TTP. However, females in certain situations such as pregnancy may present acute TTP attacks [4]. Females are more frequently affected than males, with almost twice the incidence, because of the risk of an acute TTP attack precipitated during pregnancy [5, 6]. The symptomatology is strongly represented by neurological changes, usually with a sudden appearance, and marked by a picture of recurrent relapses that signal the persistence of the disease during the course of treatment. In addition, the patient may have kidney manifestations and fever.With regard to the importance of a differential diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathic disorders, we present a case of inherited ADAMTS13 deficiency with initial clinical features that mimicked a recurrent immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Because inherited TTP is extremely rare and complicates the course of pregnancy, the differential diagnosis of this disease is important. For this reason, diagnosis of microangiopathic disorders should be based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings.CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old feoderm woman from the Northeastern region of Brazil was hospitalized during her first pregnancy in the Fundação de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco (HEMOPE), a hematologic reference hospital. She presented microcytosis (mean corpuscular volume of 74 fL/red cell), hypochromic anemia (hemoglobin of 6.5 g/dL and mean corpuscular hemoglobin of 21.8 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets of 11 × 109/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 183 U/l, reticulocyte count of 1.82%, serum iron of 38 μg/dl, transferrin saturation of 11.8%, and ecchymosis with severe hemorrhagic events in the second month of gestation. Prothrombin and activated thromboplastin time were normal.Her physical examination on admission to our hospital revealed that she was a conscious woman who was afebrile, anicteric, pale, and with a good general condition. She was oriented and cooperative and no edema was observed. Her mental status was normal. There was no spinal deformity or tenderness, no subcutaneous nodules, and no focal neurological deficits. A motor and sensory examination did not show abnormalities. Her neurological examination was normal. A medical examination was remarkable for mild petechial lesions in her lower and upper limbs. She had a blood pressure (BP) value of 140/80 mmHg. An ultrasound examination on admission showed a fetus in a transverse position without biometrics abnormality detection, and normal amniotic fluid and placenta. The fetal heart rate was normal (140 beats per minute) and there were no contractions. Her laboratory data (Table 1) revealed no other changes and renal failure was not presented. She has no history of excessive alcoholic drinking, tobacco smoking, or illicit drug usage. Her family history shows no neurological diseases and no hematologic diseases. However, her cousin had thrombocytopenia and died without a definitive diagnosis.Table 1                      Laboratory tests performed on the first day after admission and results                    Complete blood countCoagulationErythrocytes3.52 × 1012 cells/LPT-INR1Hemoglobin6.5 g/dLaPTT35 secondsHematocrit27.7%Fib4.41 g/LWhite blood cells9.94 × 109/LOther testsPlatelets11 × 109/LAST35 U/LReticulocyte count1.92%ALT19 U/L  Cr1.1 mg/dL  Urea40 mg/dL  Na140 mEq/L  K3.9 mEq/L  Total bilirubin1.0 mg/dL  Uric acid7.3 mg/dL  Lactate dehydrogenase183 U/L  Ferritin blood test148 ng/Ml  Transferrin saturation11.8%  Serum iron38 μg/dL  B12 vitamin668.4 pg/mL                    ALT alanine aminotransferase, aPTT activated partial thromboplastin time, AST aspartate aminotransferase, Cr creatinine, Fib fibrinogen, K potassium, Na sodium, PT-INR prothrombin time-international normalized ratioDuring clinical investigation in the HEMOPE (Fundação de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco), our patient obtained an initial diagnosis suggestive of ITP based on the clinical framework, absence of schizocytes (triangular, helmet red blood cells) in peripheral blood, and nonspecific myelogram (Fig. 1). Her bone marrow was hypercellular for erythroid (27% cellularity) and had granulocytic (61% cellularity) and megakaryocytic sectors, which showed some signs of atypicality and the presence of decreased platelet genesis (Fig. 2). Steroid therapy with prednisone (60 mg per day) was started, but without adequate response, treatment with immunoglobulin was performed. Our patient remained with platelets of 17 × 109/L with severe hemorrhagic events (gingivorrhagia, epistaxis), and splenectomy was indicated. One week after this surgery, she showed high BP, headache, hepatic enzyme alterations, and LDH of 1675 U/l evolving to cesarean delivery with 27 weeks' gestation in another emergency hospital due to the suggestive framework of hemolysis with elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome raised by the Medical Obstetrics Board. The baby was born healthy and with no clinical complications so far. Due to the persistence of MAHA, thrombocytopenia in the puerperium, and the presence of schizocytes in a new peripheral blood sample (Fig. 3), the hypothesis of TTP was proposed, since the persistence of the clinical framework did not support the hypothesis of HELLP syndrome. Plasmapheresis was indicated. After two sessions, there was an increase in platelet counts of 17 × 109/L to 67 × 109/L. Her serum level of LDH (210 U/l) was normalized in 1 week after plasmapheresis. Figure 4 shows the evolution of platelet counts before and after plasmapheresis. The results of ADAMTS 13 enzyme activity < 5% were received with no inhibitor present, with confirmed diagnosis of congenital TTP and not acquired TTP or other differential diagnosis. The clinical course of clinical symptoms, treatment, and clinical findings are shown in Fig. 4.

Change in platelets before and after therapeutic plasma exchange. TPE therapeutic plasma exchangeDuring the following 2 months, she developed recurring monthly episodes of TTP with hypochromic anemia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic events, and petechial lesions in her body that indicated initiation of a preventive fresh frozen plasma (FFP) monthly infusion (10 mL/kg per dose). She has remained free of recurrences without schizocytes in her blood count since preventive treatment was started in September 2017. Up until now, her child does not have thrombocytopenia or symptoms of the disease. He has been asymptomatic without any treatment.DISCUSSION: We report here the clinical and biological findings of a congenital TTP during pregnancy in a 20-year-old woman which was misdiagnosed as ITP and had been wrongly referred to splenectomy and cesarean delivery.TTP is primarily caused by an autoimmune mechanism. However, it is also described as a non-immune hereditary form: inherited TTP or Upshaw–Schulman syndrome (USS) is rare with only 100 cases described worldwide. Inherited TTP is caused by a mutation in the ADAMTS13 gene (9q34), encoding ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease involved in the cleavage of ultra-large vWF multimers with a penetrance of over 90%. Early TTP in childhood and adolescence represents < 10% of all cases of TTP. Due to its rarity, many cases are underdiagnosed (approximately 30% as hemolytic-uremic syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, Evans syndrome, or hematological malignancy). The initial episode of inherited TTP occurs during childhood or neonatal period, which may suggest that the neonatal period is a time of physiologic stress for this disease. The clinical manifestations are highly variable with mild manifestations of isolated thrombocytopenia throughout childhood in some children, and severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with episodes of thrombocytopenia and MAHA developing soon after birth in other patients. The severity of the disease is variable and related to specific mutations of ADAMTS13. There is also a greater renal dysfunction in the non-idiopathic form [1].When associated with pregnancy, most symptomatic cases of TTP occur during the second half of pregnancy and are characterized by a high frequency of USS (33%), which justifies why our patient was not diagnosed earlier [7]. This is the main cause of attacks during pregnancy, along with a hypercoagulable state with ADAMTS13 deficiency [4].Misdiagnoses may occur because hereditary TTP is a very rare hemolytic anemia and, along with thrombocytopenia, is attributed to other causes such as ITP, HELLP syndrome, and acquired TTP. In this case, the misdiagnosis of ITP occurred because ITP is not typically associated with microangiopathic changes on the peripheral blood smear such as schistocytes and does not cause renal or neurological abnormalities (unless caused by bleeding, which is rare) [8]. However, ITP was a wrong diagnosis because our patient did not present severe ADAMTS13 deficiency [9].Other systemic pregnancy-associated syndromes such as HELLP may lead to a misdiagnosis of inherited TTP. HELLP syndrome (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count) occurs with pregnancy induced by preeclampsia or hypertensive nephropathy, and may cause multiple organ failure [10]. HELLP diagnostic criteria (low serum haptoglobin levels and elevated indirect bilirubin levels in association with elevation in liver enzymes after ruling out other causes of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia) are not useful for discriminating between hereditary TTP and HELLP because both diseases may be associated with thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia with microangiopathic changes on the peripheral blood smear [11]. Differentiating HELLP syndrome from TTP is occasionally possible when abnormalities persist following delivery [12], and patients with HELLP syndrome do not present severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and require the treatment of the underlying syndrome such as delivery rather than plasma infusion, which is for inherited TTP. In this case, the early detection (at second month of pregnancy) of anemia and thrombocytopenia is also unusual in HELLP syndrome, a possible sign to avoid the misdiagnosis of HELLP syndrome.Acquired TTP is more common than inherited TTP. Both are characterized by thrombocytopenia and MAHA without other causes, and may present renal insufficiency or neurologic abnormalities. They are caused by severely deficient activity of the vWF protease ADAMTS13 (activity < 10%). However, acquired TTP is caused by an inhibitory autoantibody, and this usually can be detected at the same time as ADAMTS13 measurement [13].In the case of USS, TTP occurs as early as the first pregnancy, while the acquired form may occur at any gestation period. The fetal loss rate is high (40%) due to erroneous and late diagnoses, and fetal extraction does not improve TTP symptoms. Clinical pain (fever, thrombocytopenia, MAHA, renal failure, and neurologic symptoms) is observed in < 10% of patients, and the most frequent signs are MAHA and severe thrombocytopenia (usually < 30,000). In congenital TTP, plasma infusion restores ADAMTS13 levels and improves symptoms. Immunosuppressive therapy is unnecessary [4].The possibility of hereditary TTP diagnosis should be considered in a patient who presents MAHA and thrombocytopenia. A laboratory study reported schistocytes on peripheral blood smears, low platelet counts, and ADAMTS13 deficiency (<10% normal values) in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, suggesting a diagnosis of congenital TTP [14].Acute episodes of congenital TTP may be treated by plasma infusion (10–15 ml/kg per day), but exchange transfusion is usually required for newborns [15]. Some patients may require chronic treatment with periodic therapeutic plasma exchange, while others can only be treated when their condition worsens. At the time of the onset of acute episodes, the physician should monitor clinical impacts to minimize the patient’s risks. Patients with a chronic relapsing disease course may be considered for prophylactic plasma therapy. Regular plasma infusions to maintain ADAMTS13 activity levels around 15% are required during pregnancy [16].In the absence of treatment, TTP is a rapidly fatal disease (mortality rate > 90%). The introduction of therapeutic plasma exchange and plasma infusion has led to a decrease in the mortality rate to around 15% [17].Our reported case of a pregnant woman with inherited TTP is unusual because this case presents atypical clinical features of hereditary ADAMTS13 deficiency. Clear signs of hemolysis, renal failure, or neurological symptoms are not present which can indicate that clinical manifestations of inherited TTP are extremely variable. Inherited TTP is not a widely known mimicker of ITP. Although repeated peripheral blood is recommended to exclude inherited TTP in patients with recurrent thrombocytopenia, our patient did not present schistocytes in repeated peripheral blood.CONCLUSION:Congenital TTP should be included in differential diagnoses. It is essential to determine the ADAMTS13 activity in patients with thrombocytopenia with an unknown etiology. Elucidating the correct and early detection of ADAMTS13 deficiency is relevant for the patient's prognosis, reducing morbidity and mortality. The correct diagnosis allows appropriate treatment, which is an important fact to prevent severe sequels and to avoid useless therapies such as steroid therapy.;

It is seen in a wide variety of medical conditions, presenting as symmetrical gangrene of two or more extremities without large blood vessel obstruction.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 44-year-old Chinese man who was diagnosed with alcohol-related severe acute pancreatitis and presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and intractable vomiting. On the fourth day of admission, the patient developed cyanosis and gangrene of the fingers bilaterally. His cyanosis and gangrene did not resolve despite tapering of the vasopressor treatment. Gradually, his digital gangrene improved after administration of anti-platelet medication and pentoxifylline.CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of symmetrical peripheral gangrene occurring after acute pancreatitis with successful resolution. We highlight the importance of prompt and aggressive fluid resuscitation and consideration of multiple treatment options to prevent a hypovolemic state caused by acute pancreatitis.;INTRODUCTION: Severe acute pancreatitis is a serious condition that can result in both local and systemic complications. Systemic complications can involve the gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and neurological systems, as well as the vascular system. Such complications add to morbidity and mortality, but they have rarely been characterized in symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG).SPG, sometimes termed purpura fulminans, is uncommon but not rare in critically ill patients. It is characterized by a distal ischemic change of two or more extremities without large blood vessel occlusion or vasculitis. The latter complication is usually observed in the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, low cardiac output state, collagen vascular disease, anti-phospholipid syndrome, and drugs such as ergot, vasopressin, and noradrenaline [1–3]. It is rarely associated with acute pancreatitis. In this report, we describe a case of a man who developed SPG as a complication of severe acute pancreatitis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Chinese man, who was an occasional smoker and social drinker, presented with complaints of acute pain in his upper abdomen and vomiting of particulate material resembling coffee grounds during the 24h before admission. His pain had developed 8–10h after consumption of Kaoliang liquor (3000ml of homemade liquor consisting of approximately 58% alcohol) over a period of 3 days while at home. Initially, he presented with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Because of aggravation of epigastric pain with subsequent vomiting of coffee ground–like material and passage of tarry stools, he was admitted to the emergency room by ambulance. His pain was dull, aching, and became aggravated upon eating. He had intractable vomiting approximately 30 times and subsequently vomited coffee ground–like material on the day of admission. His past medical history included two episodes of alcohol-related acute pancreatitis without mention of diabetes mellitus, claudication, cardiovascular disease, or illicit drug abuse. The patient denied steatorrhea, maldigestion, or recent body weight loss, which excluded possible chronic pancreatitis.His initial vital signs revealed blood pressure of 74/27mmHg, heart rate of 152 beats/min, and body temperature of 38.7 °C. His clinical picture was compatible with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with shock status. His physical examination revealed that his abdomen was mildly distended with tenderness over the epigastric area. Chest, extremity, and other systemic examinations were unremarkable. Routine laboratory investigations revealed a hemoglobin level of 11.6g/dl, white blood cell count of 14,000/μl, amylase of 680U/L, lipase of 1125U/L, albumin of 2.0g/dl, total bilirubin of 0.61mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase of 110U/L, γ-glutamyl transferase of 70U/L, C-reactive protein of 24.49mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase of 362U/L, and creatine phosphokinase of 489U/L. He had impaired renal function with blood urea nitrogen of 28mg/dl and creatinine of 2.3mg/dl. Impaired liver function with aspartate transaminase of 250U/L and alanine transaminase of 47U/L were also noted. He had high anion gap metabolic acidosis characterized by a lactic acid level of 5.75mmol/L, arterial blood pH of 7.058, bicarbonate level of 5.1mmol/L, anion gap of 32.1, and ethanol of 116mg/dl. His laboratory test result for serum ketone bodies was negative. His coagulation profile was consistent with SIRS with shock status and elevated D-dimer levels. His initial central venous pressure was recorded as 4mmHg. A diagnostic screen for sepsis showed unremarkable blood culture results (Table 1). His Ranson’s criteria scores were 3 on admission and 2 after 48h. Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and abdomen revealed a picture compatible with acute pancreatitis, CT severity index grade E.Table 1                      Survey for symmetrical peripheral gangrene                    Laboratory test (normal values)Laboratory valueHBsAgNonreactiveHCV antibodyNonreactiveCryoglobulinNegativeESR, mm/h (0–15)69mm/hRPR/VDRL testNegativeCold agglutinin antibodies (<1:16×(−), 1:16X(+))<1:16C3, mg/dl (86–160)143C4, mg/dl (17–45)30Protein C, % (70–140%)78.7Anti-thrombin III, % (75–125%)73.4c-ANCA, IU/ml (<2)0.1ANA (<1:20)<1:20Anti-DNA, <Day 12 after admission10(−), 10–15(+/−), >15(+)0.1(−)Anti-cardiolipin IgM, MPL U/ml (<10)0.1Anti-cardiolipin IgG, IU/ml (<10)0.2DIC profile Platelets (150,000–400,000/μl)170,000/μl PT, s (8.0–12.0)12.5 INR1.27 aPTT, s (24.3–32.7)33.1 D-dimer, ng/ml (<500)4441.30 Fibrinogen, mg/dl (150–350)559.5 CEA, ng/ml (0–5)3.77 AFP, ng/ml (1.09–8.04)3.20 CA 19-9, U/ml (0–37)6.52 PSA, ng/ml (0–4)0.622                    AFP, α-fetoprotein, ANA, anti-nuclear antibodies, c-ANCA, cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, aPTT, activated partial thromboplastin time, C3, complement component 3, C4, complement component 4, CA 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, c-ANCA, cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen, DIC, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen, HCV, hepatitis C virus, Ig, immunoglobulin, INR, international normalized ratio, PSA, prostate-specific antigen, PT, prothrombin time, RPR/VDRL, rapid plasma regain/venereal disease research laboratoryAccording to the revised Atlanta classification of pancreatitis, the patient was diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis due to persistent organ failure (profound shock lasting for more than 48h and acute kidney injury with oliguria status after emergent hemodialysis).He was treated promptly and aggressively with intravenous fluids with normal saline. His intravenous fluids were given as a 20ml/kg bolus, followed by a maintenance dose of 3ml/kg/h. He was also prescribed analgesic for pain relief. Because the patient had profound shock and a poor response to fluid resuscitation, a vasopressor was administered with intravenous norepinephrine at an infusion rate of 4μg/min for 2 days through the central venous line. This was discontinued after his blood pressure was restored. Upper GI panendoscopy was conducted because of vomitus of coffee ground material, which revealed a Mallory-Weiss tear and acute gastric ulcer with a history of recent hemorrhage. An antibiotic (ceftriaxone) and a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) were administered. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for refractory acidosis and contrast media removal. The patient responded well to aggressive, conservative management. On the fourth day after hospitalization, a bilateral bluish discoloration of the fingers was noted. A gradual painful sensation developed 5 days after an acrocyanotic lesion was found (Fig. 1).                                      Fig. 1                      Acrocyanosis on day 9 after admissionDry gangrene and a limited range of motion of the fingers developed 9 days after the lesion was noted. Peripheral pulses were palpable in both the upper and lower extremities. The results of laboratory tests for SPG, comprising infection, malignancy, and the autoimmune system, were unremarkable (Table 1). Transesophageal echocardiography, carotid Doppler ultrasound, and sonography of the upper extremity vessels also were unremarkable. The patient was administered two doses of oral aspirin 75mg/day and two doses of oral pentoxifylline 400mg/day for 20 days. Because of upper GI tract bleeding noted on admission, heparin was not considered. The gangrenous lesion was kept warm and was not touched, as much as possible. The patient’s condition improved steadily over the next 7 days. His pain decreased, and his range of motion improved. Gradual desquamation of his finger skin occurred, with shedding of gangrenous scabs from the tips of his fingers and complete resolution (Fig. 2a, b). The patient was discharged from the hospital stay 26 days later. The patient responded well to the treatment and returned to his normal daily activities during outpatient follow-up.                                      Fig. 2                      a Day 12 after admission: gangrenous change over the fingers on day 9 after acrocynosis noted. b Day 26 after admission: resolution of symmetrical peripheral gangrene on day 22 after acrocyanosis noted.DISCUSSION: SPG is a relatively rare phenomenon characterized by symmetrical distal ischemic damage that leads to gangrene of two or more sites in the absence of large blood vessel obstruction, where vasoconstriction rather than thrombosis is implicated as the underlying pathophysiology [1, 4]. The gangrenous lesions initially appear in the form of acrocyanotic and dusky discolorations of the skin starting from the distal extremity within 24–48h and resemble lesions associated with erythematous cold extremity exposure. Gangrene most commonly occurs in the distal extremities, such as the fingers, toes, tips of the nose, and ear lobules, whereas the lips or genitalia may be affected in severe cases [5]. Peripheral pulses are usually palpable as a result of sparing of the large vessels. Up to 85% of patients with SPG attributed to DIC and other proposed mechanisms, such as the Shwartzman reaction, bacterial endotoxin release, low flow states, and spastic process of vessels [2, 6–8]. The mortality rate ranges from 30% to 50% of surviving patients, in whom it is common for at least one limb to be amputated [2, 4, 9]. A wide array of infective and non-infective etiological factors have been linked with the development of SPG, such as bacterial and viral infections (e.g., Clostridium perfringens and Neisseria meningitides), sepsis, shock status, cardiovascular problems, and treatment with vasoactive agents, such as vasopressin, dopamine, and noradrenaline [3].We conducted a review of the English-language medical literature, which revealed rare occasions of patients experiencing SPG with presentation in only the upper limb precipitated by acute pancreatitis [10, 11]. Blue toe syndrome complicated by acute pancreatitis or arteriopancreatic syndrome may be identical to SPG at different stages of the clinical course.Acute pancreatitis usually presents with low volemic state, hypercoagulation, and hemoconcentration, which can contribute to low flow and vascular disturbance. This not only leads to local pancreatic microcirculatory impairment but also involves distant microvascular and macrovascular circulation. It has varied presentations, ranging from isolated intravascular thrombosis due to DIC, which may result in vascular occlusion and further progression to SPG.In our patient, we collected laboratory data that did not resemble DIC. Though high-dose vasopressor treatment related to SPG is well described in the literature [3], we administered norepinephrine to our patient at a suboptimal dose and only for a brief period (2 days) that did no correlate with the timeline of SPG, which developed 2 days after discontinuation of the vasopressor. Thus, we believe that acute pancreatitis in our patient was highly associated with the occurrence of SPG. In patients with acute pancreatitis complicated by SPG, fluid resuscitation should be administered first, instead of vasopressor treatment, except for cases where there is refractory shock status. Prompt fluid resuscitation, empirical antibiotics, and anti-coagulant therapy may improve the flow state and control the underlying infection, which will further alleviate the DIC episode.CONCLUSION:We report this case to highlight the importance of early identification and treatment of pre-gangrenous changes in limbs to avoid amputation. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that imaging has captured the clinical sequence of events from onset of gangrene to localization of a typically disseminating phenomenon. During the regenerative process, meticulous care of the affected areas is required to prevent infections and ensure a favorable outcome.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of SPG after acute pancreatitis with successful resolution. We highlight the importance of early, aggressive fluid resuscitation and multiple treatment options to prevent a hypovolemic state caused by acute pancreatitis.;

Overheated polytetrafluoroethylene can generate toxic fumes, inducing acute pulmonary edema in some cases. However, neither the etiology nor the radiological features of this condition have been determined. For clarification, we report an illustrative case, together with the first comprehensive literature review.CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 35-year-old Japanese man who developed severe dyspnea presented to our hospital. He had left a polytetrafluoroethylene-coated pan on a gas-burning stove for 10 hours while unconscious. Upon admission, he was in severe respiratory distress. A chest computed tomographic scan showed massive bilateral patchy consolidations with ground-glass opacities and peripheral area sparing. A diagnosis of polytetrafluoroethylene fume–induced pulmonary edema was made. He was treated with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, which dramatically alleviated his symptoms and improved his oxygenation. He was discharged without sequelae on hospital day 11. A literature review was performed to survey all reported cases of polytetrafluoroethylene fume–induced pulmonary edema. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and OvidSP databases for reports posted between the inception of the databases and 30 September 2014, as well as several Japanese databases (Ichushi Web, J-STAGE, Medical Online, and CiNii). Two radiologists independently interpreted all chest computed tomographic images. Eighteen relevant cases (including the presently reported case) were found. Our search revealed that (1) systemic inflammatory response syndrome was frequently accompanied by pulmonary edema, and (2) common computed tomography findings were bilateral ground-glass opacities, patchy consolidation and peripheral area sparing. Pathophysiological and radiological features were consistent with the exudative phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the contrast between the lesion and the spared peripheral area was striking and was distinguishable from the common radiological features of acute respiratory distress syndrome.CONCLUSION: The essential etiology of polytetrafluoroethylene fume–induced pulmonary edema seems to be increased pulmonary vascular permeability caused by an inflammatory response to the toxic fumes. The radiological findings that distinguish polytetrafluoroethylene fume–induced pulmonary edema can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or a patchy consolidation with clear sparing of the peripheral area.;INTRODUCTION: Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or Teflon® (DuPont, Wilmington, DE, USA), is ubiquitous in materials commonly used in cooking and industrial applications owing to its thermal stability and non-stick properties. However, overheated PTFE generates toxic fumes that can occasionally cause acute pulmonary edema [1-16]. To date, neither the etiology nor the radiological features of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema has been determined [1-16]. We therefore report an illustrative case and have conducted the first comprehensive literature review to clarify the etiology and radiological features of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema.CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 35-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea and dry cough. He had fallen asleep while leaving a PTFE-coated pan on the stove, which caught fire. He awoke 10 hours later with severe dyspnea and noticed that the room was filled with white smoke. The PTFE coating of the pan was completely burned off, although the fire had not spread outside the pan. Upon admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.1°C, heart rate, 100 beats/min, blood pressure, 131/97mmHg, respiratory rate, 30 breaths/min, and percutaneous oxygen saturation, 98% (on oxygen 10L/min via a non-rebreather mask). The patient was alert and denied using any medications, including illicit drugs. Auscultation revealed bilateral coarse crackles. His white blood cell count was 22,100/μl with 91.2% neutrophils, and his arterial oxygen pressure was 233.5mmHg while he was on 10L/min oxygen. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltration (Figure 1A). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed massive, bilateral, patchy consolidations with ground-glass opacities and sparing of the peripheral areas (Figure 1B). These lesions were distributed in a dorsally dominant manner (Figure 1B). The patient’s echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were normal, so a diagnosis of PTFE fume–induced, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was made. The patient was admitted and treated with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and intravenous sivelestat (Elaspol®, Ono Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan). NPPV was initiated in a setting of positive end-expiratory pressure of 8cmH2O and intravenous sivelestat at a dosage of 4.8 mg/kg/day, which dramatically alleviated his symptoms and improved his oxygenation on the day of admission. His respiratory status rapidly improved, and a second chest CT scan on day 9 revealed complete resolution of the infiltrates (Figure 1B). The patient was discharged to home without any sequelae on hospital day 11.                                      Figure 1                      Chest X-ray and computed tomographic scan obtained upon admission and on day 9 of hospitalization. (A) Bilateral infiltration shadows were detected on admission (left), which had completely disappeared at day 9 (right). (B) On admission, bilateral patchy consolidations with ground-glass opacities and sparing of peripheral areas were found (left). On day 9 of the patient’s hospitalization, these shadows had completely disappeared (right).On 30 September 2014, we searched for all reported cases of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema on the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, OvidSP and several Japanese databases (Ichushi Web, J-STAGE, Medical Online and CiNii), without language restriction and using the following keywords: “polymer fume fever,” “Teflon®,” “polytetrafluoroethylene,” “pulmonary/lung edema” and “acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).” Three of the authors (RH, YO and RI) performed independent screenings. Cross-referencing was performed, and all the relevant case reports and studies were included. We excluded the following: (1) cases without evidence of pulmonary edema, (2) cases without an association with PTFE fumes and (3) academy meeting abstracts. The search produced 121 articles, of which 17 were potential candidates [1-16]. Next, clinical features including patient characteristics, the situation under which exposure occurred, symptoms, treatment and outcome were reviewed by three intensivists (RH, YO, and RI). One report was excluded because of insufficient information [3], leaving 16 reports and 17 relevant cases [1,2,4-16] for inclusion in this review. The temperature of the overheated PTFE was estimated based on information in the relevant reports (molding settings [4,5,11], cigarettes [17] and an overheated pan [18]). SIRS was defined according to the criteria originally proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference [19]. All CT images of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema were interpreted independently by two chest radiologists (KK and TT). The distribution of the disease and the dominant lesion were also noted. Thirteen reports without CT findings were excluded [1,4-14], resulting in four reports [2,3,15,16] and eight cases ultimately being eligible for inclusion in this review.The clinical characteristics of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema described in this review, including our patient, are summarized in Table 1. The patient demographics of the cases in the literature review consisted of 16 men and 2 women, aged 21 to 59 years. Many patients were smokers (12 of 18), and most did not have any comorbidities (15 of 18). Among all of the reports included here, seven cases involved exposure to PTFE-containing materials in factories or laboratories, 6 cases were of patients who had smoked PTFE-contaminated cigarettes and 5 reports described exposure to fumes from overheating PTFE-coated kitchenware in the home. Common symptoms were dyspnea (17 of 18), cough (12 of 18) and flu-like symptoms such as fever (9 of 18) and chills (6 of 18). SIRS was frequently present (10 of 18). All patients had evidence of exposure to fumes developed from overheated (391 to 875°C) PTFE. One patient was exposed to PTFE fumes for 9 hours and died 5 hours after admission despite intensive treatment that included intubation [11]. Neither NPPV nor neutrophil elastase inhibitor was used in previously reported cases. Transbronchial lung biopsy was performed in one case, which revealed marked neutrophil migration into the alveoli with edema in the alveolar septa [12]. Table 2 shows the chest CT characteristics of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema, including our patient. Four patients underwent chest CT on the day of admission: two on day 2 and two on day 4. Common findings were ground-glass opacities (eight of eight), peripheral area sparing (six of eight) and patchy consolidation (four of eight). With the exception of a single patient, these lesions were distributed bilaterally (seven of eight) and predominantly on the back in most cases (five of eight).Table 1                                              Summary of clinical characteristics of polytetrafluoroethylene fume–induced pulmonary edema                                                  a                                                                  PatientAuthorsSexAge (yr)Comorbid diseaseSmokingSituationOverheated temperature (°C)Exposure timeSIRSSymptomsTreatmentOutcome (treatment period)1Harris et al.

Because of the ubiquity of this material, all health care providers need to be aware of the characteristics of this disease. Our search revealed that (1) the essential etiology can be inflammatory pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability, (2) the radiological features can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or a patchy consolidation with clear peripheral area sparing and (3) the duration of PTFE fume exposure is a possible aggravating factor.First, the essential etiology of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema can be inflammatory pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability. Flu-like symptoms and SIRS frequently accompany exposure, which are probably associated with pulmonary inflammation as a result of the toxic fumes. In one report, authors described the transbronchial lung biopsy findings in a patient with PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema, revealing marked neutrophil migration into the alveoli with alveolar edema [12]. In a laboratory study, remarkable neutrophil infiltration and an increased level of inflammatory cytokines were found in the pulmonary lavage of rats that had been exposed to PTFE fumes [20]. Both are consistent with the pathological findings regarding the exudative phase of ARDS. NPPV [21] and neutrophil elastase inhibitors [22] are known to work effectively in treating disease of this etiology.Second, the radiological features of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or patchy consolidation with clear peripheral area sparing. Bilateral ground-glass opacity and patchy consolidation are consistent with the chest CT findings regarding the exudative phase of ARDS, supporting the above-mentioned etiology. However, the contrast between the lesion and the spared peripheral area was striking, and these characteristics were clearly distinguishable from the common radiological features of ARDS. One plausible explanation for the spared area is that it is more difficult for the toxic fumes to reach the peripheral alveoli, consequently, this area escapes inflammation. The other explanation is related to the characteristics of lymph flow in the lungs. Tiny particles in PTFE fumes may be removed by the lymphatic drainage system, directly or by means of macrophage ingestion and migration [23]. The lymph proceeds in two opposite directions: centripetally in the center of the lung and centrifugally in the periphery [23,24]. Centrifugal lymph flow in the lung periphery may effectively remove PTFE particles to the pleural lymphatics rather than centripetally by means of the lymph flow to the hilum [23]. Dorsally dominant infiltration can also be shown by the characteristic of the lymph flow in the lungs. Lymphatic function is known to be poorest in dorsal lungs, resulting in poor clearance of particles [23]. The above-mentioned radiologic features can be helpful in making a diagnosis.We also noted that a temperature of approximately 400°C may be the threshold for developing PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema in humans. Animal studies involving rats have shown the development of lethal pulmonary edema when the rats were exposed to fumes produced by overheated PTFE at around 450°C [25], which is consistent with our findings.Finally, the duration of PTFE fume exposure is a possible aggravating factor. Lee and colleagues proposed a dose–response relationship between PTFE fume exposure and disease severity in that the most heavily exposed worker (patient 2) died, whereas less-exposed workers (patient 3, a foreman not restricted to the PTFE room, and patient 4, a nightshift molder) recovered [11]. Our survey also supports this finding. Lesser-exposed patients, such as those whose PTFE fume exposure was related to smoking, recovered quickly, whereas more heavily exposed patients, such as our patient, required longer treatment periods. As discussed, the patient who was exposed to PTFE fumes for 9 hours died despite intubation [11]. In comparison, we successfully treated a similar patient (exposed to fumes for 10 hours) with NPPV and early administration of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, suggesting that these are suitable treatments for cases involving pulmonary edema of this etiology [21,22].CONCLUSION:Our experience with our patient, as well as our literature review, suggest that the essential etiology of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema is increased pulmonary vascular permeability caused by an inflammatory response to the toxic fumes. The CT findings that distinguish PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or a patchy consolidation with clear peripheral area sparing.;

The development of diabetes with glycogen storage disease is exceedingly rare. The underlying pathogenesis for developing diabetes in these patients is unclear, and there are no guidelines for treatment.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 34-year-old woman of South Asian descent with glycogen storage disease type Ia, who developed uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as a young adult. Hyperglycemia was noted after childbirth, and worsened years later. Treatment for diabetes was difficult due to risks of hypoglycemia from her underlying glycogen storage disease. With minimal hypoglycemic events, the patient’s blood glucose improved with exercise in combination with a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor and an alpha glucosidase inhibitor.CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of diabetes in the setting of glycogen storage disease-Ia. Based on the literature, there appears to be a relationship between glycogen storage disease and metabolic syndrome, which likely plays a role in the pathogenesis. The management of glycemic control remains a clinical challenge, requiring management of both fasting hypoglycemia from glycogen storage disease, as well as post-prandial hyperglycemia from diabetes mellitus.;INTRODUCTION: Glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD-I) is a rare genetic condition that develops due to an inborn error of metabolism causing deficient activity of the enzyme, glucose 6-phosphatase [1]. This enzyme is essential to hydrolyze glucose-6 phosphate (G6P) into biochemically active glucose, the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Lack of this enzyme manifests clinically as hypoglycemia in the postabsorptive state, as well as complications from excess buildup of glycogen and G6P resulting in organ dysfunction including hepatomegaly and kidney disease [2].GSD-I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with an incidence of 1 out of 100,000 births [1, 3]. There are two subtypes of GSD-I, known as GSD-Ia and GSD-Ib, which are distinguished by the enzymatic deficiency (see Fig. 1). This manuscript will focus on GSD-Ia which is the more common subtype, for which there is a deficiency of the enzyme G6PC.                                      Fig. 1                      Enzyme deficiencies in glycogen storage disease type 1a vs glycogen storage disease type 1b [15]. In the final step of endogenous glucose production, glucose-6 phosphate enters the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell through a transporter known as G6PT. Upon entering the endoplasmic reticulum the enzyme glucose-6 phosphatase, also known as G6PC, hydrolyzes glucose-6 phosphate into glucose and inorganic phosphate. Glucose then leaves the endoplasmic reticulum and is released systemically. In glycogen storage disease type 1a there is a mutation of the enzyme G6PC resulting in a buildup of glucose-6 phosphate in the endoplasmic reticulum. In glycogen storage disease 1b, there is a mutation of G6PT, whereby glucose-6 phosphate cannot enter the endoplasmic reticulum to undergo the catalytic reaction. G6PT1: glucose 6 phosphate translocase 1, G6PC: glucose 6 phosphatase catalytic subunit, ER: Endoplasmic ReticulumPatients with GSD-Ia are recognized early for their episodes of hypoglycemia in childhood which can be severe, causing seizures, neurocognitive decline, as well as stunted growth [4]. Treatments such as uncooked cornstarch or continuous overnight gastric feedings are used to ensure there is sufficient glucose in the fasting state [1]. Long-term complications of the disorder include liver adenomas and steatosis, kidney dysfunction, lactic acidosis, elevated uric acid, and profound hypertriglyceridemia [4].GSD-Ia is a disorder that highlights the importance of glucose as a basic energy source throughout the body. Understanding the physiology of uptake, utilization, and storage of glucose is essential for medical treatment of various pathologies involving altered glucose metabolism. Patients with GSD-1a suffer from fasting hypoglycemia, thus it would seem paradoxical for an individual who has primarily a disease of decreased endogenous glucose production to develop diabetes. We describe a case of a patient with known GSD type Ia who developed uncontrolled diabetes. In reviewing our patient’s case presentation, we explore the pathophysiology of glucose homeostasis, and the challenge to find an appropriate medical therapy.CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old woman of South Asian descent with a past medical history of obesity [body mass index (BMI) 41.6], polycystic ovarian syndrome, psoriasis, horseshoe kidney with uric acid kidney stones, and hypothyroidism, was diagnosed at age 3 with GSD-Ia. As an infant she had hypoglycemic episodes resulting in seizures. A liver biopsy showed decreased G6PC enzymatic activity of 0.45 μmol/min/g tissue (N 3.50 ± 0.8 μmol/min/g tissue) with increased glycogen content. Gene analysis revealed a mutation of the G6PC gene homozygous for 50delGT, thus confirming the diagnosis of GSD-Ia.Initially, our patient was managed with frequent feedings and by the age of 9, a night-time cornstarch regimen was initiated to prevent hypoglycemia. She had expected complications of the disease, including uric acid kidney stones, lactic acidosis, hepatic adenomas with hepatomegaly, and diffuse steatosis.At the age 31 years, our patient became pregnant and did not undergo routine gestational diabetes screening due to her underlying GSD. Three days prior to delivery, she was incidentally noted to be hyperglycemic for the first time, with a blood glucose more than 300 mg/dL (N 70–140 mg/dL). The elevated glucose was attributed to gestational diabetes for which she was started on insulin. Treatment was complicated by severe hypoglycemia with a blood glucose of 32 mg/dL, and she subsequently refused all forms of insulin.Thereafter, our patient was lost to follow-up for 2 years. At the age of 33 years, she sought care when she had continued hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 13% (N 4.3–6.0%). On social history, our patient was working at an office job, she denied any toxic habits including smoking or alcohol use. There was no family history of consanguinity nor birth defects, her young child was healthy. She had a maternal grandmother with diabetes, and her mother had prediabetes. On examination, our patient had a BMI of 41.6, short stature, and generalized obesity. Her heart and lung examinations were unremarkable, she had an obese abdomen with hepatomegaly. A skin examination was notable for acanthosis nigricans, with scattered psoriatic patches. Neurologically, she was alert and appropriate, and her examination was non-focal. Laboratory tests were significant for elevated triglycerides of 960 mg/dL, with microalbuminuria, and otherwise normal liver function tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her abdomen showed multiple liver adenomas with diffuse steatosis. Further investigation of her diabetes showed an insulin level of 32 μIU/mL (n 1.9–23 μIU/mL), and a high c-peptide of 5.2 ng/mL (N 0.8–3.1 Ng/mL), with a fasting blood glucose of 311 mg/dL (N 70–140 mg/dL). A homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA IR) calculation to determine insulin resistance was calculated as 24.6 (N <2.5), thus indicating severe insulin resistance [5]. Despite the diagnosis of diabetes, our patient continued her regimen of 5 tablespoons (tbsp) of uncooked cornstarch at night to prevent hypoglycemia from her underlying GSD.With initial lifestyle modifications, including a lower carbohydrate diet, exercise, and attempting weight loss, our patient’s HgA1c improved from 13% to 11.9%. It was clear medication initiation was needed, however this was a challenge due to the patient’s underlying chronic liver disease, lactic acidosis, and refusal of insulin. Due to liver dysfunction, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, a renally cleared medication, was trialed first. Our patient was treated with canagliflozin, with uptitration of the dosage to 300 mg daily. She concomitantly decreased her bedtime cooked cornstarch from 5 tbsp to 3 tbsp. With these interventions, after a few months, her HgA1c improved from 11.9 to 9% without episodes of hypoglycemia but notable elevation in lactate levels from 3.2 to 5.6 mmol/L (N 0.6–2.5 mmol/L).For more effective glycemic control, an alpha glucosidase inhibitor was added. A dose of acarbose 50 mg was started three times a day with meals. A continuous glucometer monitoring system (CGMS) 1 week after starting acarbose showed downtrending night-time blood glucose with an episode of hypoglycemia in the morning (see Fig. 2). Omission of acarbose at dinner-time effectively eliminated fasting hypoglycemia. Overall, it took approximately 1 year to control her blood glucose, and at the age of 34 years, her diabetes was at goal, at which point our patient was concomitantly able to lose 11 lbs. A combination of canagliflozin, acarbose, and weight loss decreased her starting HgA1c from 13 to 6.5%. HOMA IR was reduced from 24.6 to 1.9, indicating significant improvement in insulin sensitivity.                                      Fig. 2                      Continuous glucometer monitoring system after initiation of acarbose: Our patient’s continuous glucometer monitoring system details daily blood glucose trends from April 7 to 11, 2015 after starting treatment with acarbose 50 mg three times daily with meals. Blood glucose is represented on the y-axis, and hours of the day are on the x-axis. Each day is color-coded. The blood glucose appears to trend downward after midnight. There is one hypoglycemic episode noted on Friday April 10 at 7 a.m. There is another blood glucose trough at noon post exercise. Postprandial blood glucose elevation is seen at 2 p.m. and 9 p.m.DISCUSSION: Typically, patients with GSD-Ia struggle with persistent episodes of fasting hypoglycemia, our case of a patient with GSD-Ia and type 2 DM is rare. The paradoxical nature of the two conditions presents itself as a challenge to glucose homeostasis.There are few case reports in the literature of patients with different subtypes of GSD who later developed DM. Most of these reports describe patients who develop DM in the setting of pancreatic insufficiency and insulinopenia, which does not appear to be the sole etiology in our patient with insulin resistance [4, 6]. A literature search revealed the only known cases of GSD-Ia and type 2 DM are four patients mentioned in a poster presentation at a clinical meeting. These cases differ in that three of the four patients were pediatric age, and for all cases described, glycemic control was achieved purely with weight reduction [7]. In our case, the patient was an adult, and despite rigorously attempting weight loss, she ultimately required additional medical therapy to achieve glycemic control.In determining the etiology of diabetes in our patient there are several proposals. Typically, patients with GSD-Ia have <10% of normal functioning G6PC enzymatic activity. There is, however, a spectrum of enzymatic dysfunction, while some patients have no functional G6PC, others might have partial [8]. In our case, it is plausible that with some functional enzymatic activity (12% of normal), combined with obesity and a lifestyle of a high carbohydrate diet, our patient developed insulin resistance which progressed to overt diabetes.Additionally, one study demonstrated that patients with GSD-I have an uncharacteristic insulin response to food when challenged with a glucose tolerance test. Subjects were adults with GSD-I subtypes who ingested a glucose load, and post-prandial insulin levels were measured. The results showed that these patients mounted a delayed insulin response to food, resulting in post-prandial elevated blood glucose as compared to controls [6]. A dysregulation, or overload of this mechanism, with excess carbohydrates and weight gain could explain the disproportionately elevated post-prandial levels of blood glucose evident in our case.Recent literature describes a possible correlation between GSD-Ia and the development of metabolic syndrome, which could explain the propensity for our patient to develop diabetes. Melis et al. showed that in a cohort of patients with GSD-Ia, there was a statistically significant increase in the features of metabolic syndrome when compared to those with GSD-Ib and controls [5]. There was evidence of greater insulin resistance, as well as hypertriglyceridemia, and increase in waist circumference in the GSD-Ia group. The proposed biochemical mechanism is that due to the deficiency of G6PC there is an excess of the substrate G6P in the endoplasmic reticulum, as it cannot be properly hydrolyzed. The presence of excess G6P upregulates the activity of another enzyme, 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11BHSD1), that is involved in the activation of glucocorticoids, and which has been previously thought to contribute to metabolic syndrome [5]. In this study, however, despite insulin resistance, there was no hyperglycemia described.In addition, the very nature of GSD-Ia itself with hallmarks of hypertriglyceridemia and liver steatosis likely contributed to our patient’s insulin resistance. In GSD-Ia there is excess build up of the substrate G6P which shunts into other metabolites including free fatty acids and triglycerides (see Fig. 3). This production of excess free fatty acids causes an imbalance, whereby lipid supply to the liver exceeds lipid use, which plays a role in the pathophysiology of liver steatosis [9]. The injured fatty liver leads to altered cell-signaling pathways, which brings rise to insulin resistance [10]. Without the liver sensing insulin, there is decreased hepatic glucose uptake from the portal vein after a meal, and pronounced post-prandial hyperglycemia [11].                                      Fig. 3                      Alternative pathways for glucose-6 phosphate leads to lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia: In glycogen storage disease type 1a, there is deficient glucose-6-phosphatase, which results in the shunting of the substrate glucose-6-phosphate away from glucose, into alternative pathways. This results in elevated lactic acid, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. Source: Froissart R, et al. [3]Our patient presented as a dilemma for treatment, requiring modulation of both fasting hypoglycemia from her GSD, as well as post-prandial hyperglycemia secondary to her diabetes. No guidelines exist on how to treat hyperglycemia in patients with GSD-Ia, and while insulin is an obvious option, it can exacerbate hypoglycemia. The use of a diagnostic CGMS on our patient was an effective tool that provided important information about general trends of blood glucose. The patient’s CGMS highlights her pattern of blood glucose trending down in the early morning and post-prandial hyperglycemia.Exercise in our patient modestly improved glycemic control, due to its beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and hyperglycemia, however this was not enough [12]. Medical therapy with canagliflozin improved our patient’s blood glucose in conjunction with weight loss. However, while patients with GSD already have a propensity for lactic acidosis, there is an additional risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with the use of an SGLT2 inhibitor [13]. This potential side effect could worsen our patient’s existing metabolic acidosis, and therefore the use of an SGLT2 inhibitor requires careful monitoring. Acarbose was selected as a drug of choice in our patient, based on its mechanism in decreasing gastrointestinal absorption of complex carbohydrates. It is especially effective for improving post-prandial hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia [14]. While acarbose has a lower risk of hypoglycemia than insulin, caution must be used as it can prevent absorption of carbohydrates resulting in refractory hypoglycemia with oral intake of complex carbohydrates. In our case, the combination of acarbose and an SGLT2 inhibitor with weight loss provided glycemic control.GSD-Ia remains a rare disorder, however, the life span of patients with GSD will expectantly become longer with better recognition and medical treatment. This unusual presentation of diabetes in a patient with GSD may become more frequently encountered as these patients enter adulthood, and understanding the pathophysiology to provide effective treatment will be necessary.CONCLUSION:GSD-Ia is a rare disorder which manifests with hypoglycemia and the inability to produce endogenous glucose. Despite a correlation between metabolic syndrome and GSD-Ia, there are few cases of patients with diabetes and GSD-Ia in the literature. This case reviews the pathophysiology of the metabolic disorder and highlights the rare presentation of a woman with GSD-Ia, who presented with diabetes. The challenges of treatment include worsening hypoglycemia from insulin, as well as potential kidney and liver dysfunction from GSD-Ia, which limits medication use. Exercise and diabetic medications including an alpha glucosidase inhibitor and an SGLT2 inhibitor, were the therapeutic choices used for our patient. With the increasing lifespan of GSD patients, this therapeutic challenge will likely present itself more often. Our case emphasizes the need for a discussion of the pathophysiology of the disease, and the risks versus benefits of different treatment regimens.;

Due to unspecific symptoms, misdiagnosis is likely and could potentially endanger a patient as well as her fetus.CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old white woman presented with mild right-sided abdominal pain, which increased during palpation and movement, at 26 + 3 weeks’ gestational age. Ultrasound imaging initially showed a round and well-demarcated structure, which appeared to be in contact with her uterine wall, leading to a suspected diagnosis of an infarcted leiomyoma. However, she reported increasing levels of pain and laboratory tests showed a significant drop in her initially normal hemoglobin level. A magnetic resonance imaging scan finally revealed a large type III rectus sheath hematoma on the right side. Because of progressive blood loss into her rectus sheath under conservative therapy, with a significant further decrease in her hemoglobin levels, surgical treatment via right-sided paramedian laparotomy was initiated. During the operation the arterial bleed could be ligated. She eventually achieved complete convalescence and delivered a healthy newborn spontaneously after 40 weeks of gestation.CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the clinical and diagnostic features of rectus sheath hematoma and shows the anatomical aspects of the rectus sheath, simplifying early and correct diagnosis.;INTRODUCTION: Rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is a rare condition and only a few cases during pregnancy have been reported [1]. RSH results from a rupture of one of the epigastric arteries leading to an acute bleeding into the rectus sheath. Due to anatomical conditions these hematomas may contain high amounts of blood, thus leading to hypovolemia and hemorrhagic shock and possible maternal and fetal mortality. Particularly in pregnancy, high mortality rates of up to 13 % for the mother and 50 % for the fetus have been reported [2].In many cases diagnosis remains difficult as the symptoms of RSH may mimic several other clinical conditions. Tolcher et al. reviewed ten cases of spontaneous RSH in pregnancy. In 50 % of these cases, immediate caesarean section was performed, eventually leading to preterm deliveries [1]. In all of these prescribed cases, a correct preoperative diagnosis was missing, indicating its high importance. To facilitate diagnosis, we analyzed the clinical and radiological features of RSH and highlighted the pathophysiology via a systematic anatomic workup.CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old white woman (II gravida/I para) presented at the gestational age of 26 + 3 weeks with right-sided abdominal pain. The course of her pregnancy up to this point was normal. There had been no pre-existing illnesses. She merely reported a flu-like infection associated with severe coughing fits the week before, which was almost in complete remission. She had not received any anticoagulant therapy and had no indications for any other anticoagulant abnormalities. No trauma could be recollected and there had been no further surgical interventions.On admission, she presented hemodynamically stable with vital signs within normal limits. Physical and pelvic examinations appeared normal apart from moderate maternal obesity and a mild tenderness in her right upper quadrant which increased when moving. Ultrasound revealed a normal progression of pregnancy, regular percentiles of fetal growth, and a normal Doppler ultrasound state. The placenta was located at the rear aspect of her uterus without indications for a retroplacental hematoma or acute abruptio placentae. However, a 9.16 × 9.73 cm, round, well-demarcated, and partly hypoechoic/isoechoic structure, which appeared to be in contact with her uterine wall but clearly separated from the placenta, was identified (Fig. 1a). Its inhomogeneous internal structure led to the suspected diagnosis of an acute symptomatic infarcted pedunculated myoma. As a possible differential diagnosis we considered a hematoma of unknown origin. However, initial laboratory findings were consistent with our first hypothesis and did not show a typical HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) constellation or other severe abnormalities. Her hemoglobin (Hb) level was 11.8 g/dl and her level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was slightly elevated at 20.4 mg/l. Furthermore, her coagulation parameters appeared to be normal.                                      Fig. 1                      a A 26-year-old pregnant woman at 27 weeks’ gestation presented with right-sided abdominal pain. Transversal transabdominal ultrasound of her right lumbar region showed a 9.16 × 9.73 cm, round, well-demarcated and partly hypoechoic/isoechoic structure, appearing to be in contact with her uterine wall. b Magnetic resonance imaging of her abdomen, coronal view: Type III rectus sheath hematoma (1) measuring 11 × 12 × 20 cm, mainly located at the right side and starting to displace her uterine wall. The placenta (2) is located at the rear aspect of her uterus and appears to be normal, without sign of acute abruptio placentae. c Magnetic resonance imaging of her abdomen, axial view: The fetus (3) is lying in cephalic presentation. Note the associated edema of the subcutaneous tissueWe initiated analgesic therapy with acetaminophen and piritramide as well as intramuscular dexamethasone injection as a fetal respiratory distress prophylaxis.Initially, her abdominal pain subsided mildly and cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring showed physiological values. On day 2 after admission, she reported an acute exacerbation of her abdominal pain. Sonographic reevaluation indicated an increase in size of the aforementioned structure. Laboratory findings showed a significant decrease in Hb to 8.1 g/dl, negating our initial diagnosis. We suspected an acute hematoma of unknown origin or an abdominal bleed and initiated an emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which showed a RSH measuring 11 × 12 × 20 cm that was located at the right side of her anterior abdominal wall (Fig. 1b, c).We started conservative treatment with analgesics and balanced intravenous fluids. After a few hours she developed severe and progressive pain. Repetitive laboratory tests showed a further decrease in Hb levels. She developed hypotension, indicating surgical exploration by right-sided paramedian laparotomy. After incision of the anterior fasciae of her rectus sheath the hematoma was recovered, measuring approximately 1000 ml of fresh and coagulated blood. At the caudal aspect a sputtering hemorrhage of the inferior epigastric artery was found and both ends were ligated (Fig. 2). Two 16G drains were placed and put under suction. A total of 4 units of packed red blood cells were transfused. Intraoperative fetal monitoring was conducted by transabdominal ultrasound and showed normal fetal heart rates. After the procedure her Hb levels remained stable and her complete convalescence was swift. She was discharged on day 5 post surgery. Fetal parameters appeared to be normal.                                      Fig. 2                      a Virtualization of the anterior abdominal wall: On the left side the oblique external muscle is shown, located on top of the three flat muscles of the lateral abdominal wall. On the right-hand side multiple layers were excluded to show the underlying internal oblique muscle and the transversus abdominis. The rectus sheath forms a central part of the functional system. It contains the rectus abdominis and the pyramidalis muscle. b Cadaver study, abdominal wall, ventral view: opened rectus sheath (*), clearly visible is the rectus abdominis muscle (#) with its intramuscular intersections.

The cranial aspect of the rectus abdominis muscle (#) was severed and multiple small intramuscular hematomas were noted. At the caudal aspect a sputtering hemorrhage of the inferior epigastric artery was found and both ends were ligated. i Operative finding: The fascia of the transversus abdominis (*) muscle remained intact. No caesarean section was performedAt 40 weeks’ of gestational age she underwent normal spontaneous vaginal delivery under intensified peripartum controls (Table 1).Table 1                      Timeline of case                    Admission to hospital29 January 2016Operation procedure30 January 2016Discharge from hospital04 February 2016Spontaneous vaginal delivery04 May 2016DISCUSSION: To depict the relevant anatomical structures for the pathogenesis of RSH, we performed a cadaver study using formalin-fixed bodies of cadaver donors.The rectus sheath forms a central part of the anterior abdominal wall. It connects the xiphoid process and the costal cartilages of the fifth, sixth and the seventh rib with the os pubis and contains two muscles: the rectus abdominis and the pyramidalis muscle. The medial border is formed by the fibrous linea alba and the lateral border is formed by aponeuroses of the external oblique, the internal oblique, and the transversus abdominis, building the linea semilunaris. The ventral and dorsal limitations differ between the cranial and caudal aspect of the structure. The linea arcuata runs horizontally and is located approximately 5 cm caudal to the umbilicus. Inferior to the linea arcuata, the aponeuroses of all three muscles run anteriorly and the rectus sheath is separated from the peritoneum only by the transversalis fascia. Superior to the arcuate line, the layers of the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis muscle are separated and run anteriorly and posteriorly of the musculus rectus abdominis (Fig. 2c) [3–5].The blood supply is provided by the epigastric arteries, which run longitudinally within the rectus sheath (Fig. 2d–f) [6, 7].RSHs are mostly caused by trauma of the inferior epigastric artery. Whetzel and Huang [8] showed a higher number of branches originating from the inferior epigastric artery. During contraction of the rectus abdominis muscle these branching sites are burdened and exposed to shearing and straining stresses. Because of this, strong muscular contraction may cause trauma of the inferior epigastric artery, leading to a RSH [8].Risk factors include conditions that elevate intraabdominal pressure, such as coughing fits, severe vomiting, or straining during passing a stool, but also trauma, hereditary or iatrogenous coagulation abnormalities, vascular malformation, female sex, and previous surgery [9].Symptoms of profuse bleeding into the rectus sheath are often relatively unspecific and may include sudden or increasing – often unilateral – abdominal pain, palpable masses in the abdominal wall, and general conditions of a hypovolemic state, such as tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and pallor. A clinical examination may show Fothergill’s sign (an abdominal mass which stays palpable and becomes tenderer during contraction of the rectus muscle), Carnett’s sign (an increase of pain on tensing of the abdominal muscles), Cullen’s sign (periumbilical ecchymosis), or Turner’s sign (flank ecchymosis). Furthermore, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting have been reported in patients with acute RSHs [10–13].The risk of misinterpreting the aforementioned symptoms is elevated during pregnancy and correct diagnosis may be difficult. Differential obstetric diagnoses include acute abruptio placentae, infarcted myoma, preterm labor, uterine rupture, or HELLP syndrome. There are also multiple non-pregnancy-related differential diseases, such as gastroenteritis, nephritis, nephrolithiasis, perforated ulcer, pancreatic disease, hepatitis, gallbladder disease, acute appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or an intraabdominal bleed [12, 14, 15].Ultrasound poses a viable diagnostic feature in RSH. It can be used as a first-line test and is also secure in pregnant patients. RSHs, located above the arcuate line, often occur as a unilateral spindle-shaped mass. Underneath the arcuate line hematomas commonly appear spherical [15, 16]. Laboratory results typically show a significant decrease in the Hb level. Furthermore, coagulation abnormalities may be detected.In non-pregnant patients, a computed tomography (CT) scan is the diagnostic gold standard as it enables a sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. Berna et al. found a diagnostic classification of RSH in CT scans [17]. According to this classification, type I hematomas are located intramuscularly and unilaterally. Typically, type II hematomas show blood between the rectus abdominis muscle and the underlying fascia. The more severe type III hematomas show blood in the inner abdomen and the prevesical space [17]. To avoid radiation, MRI scans are a secure alternative in pregnant patients although they may have a lower diagnostic value in acute hematomas within the first 48 hours [18, 19].Conservative treatment, including analgesic therapy and fluid resuscitation, is usually possible in hemodynamically stable patients with smaller RSHs. These hematomas will normally resolve themselves within a few weeks [20, 21]. Patients under anticoagulant therapy may additionally benefit from phytonadione or substitution of fresh frozen plasma. In the case of larger hematomas, a transfusion of packed red blood cells is often needed. Hemodynamically unstable patients with expanding hematomas under conservative therapy should undergo invasive treatment, including arterial embolization or surgical decompression. Arterial embolization can be conducted by thrombin or via coiling of the vessel [22]. Classic surgical treatment includes ligation of the arterial bleed and removal of the hematoma. Tolcher et al. reported 7 out of 10 cases (70 %) of antepartum RSH in which surgical evacuation was performed [1]. In our reported case, paramedian laparotomy was conducted and finally stopped the bleeding.RSH is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, which presents with acute abdominal pain. As in the present report, unspecific symptoms of an acute RSH may mimic several other acute conditions and can easily lead to a wrong diagnosis. To prevent a hemorrhage, which potentially endangers mother and fetus or leads to preterm labor, early diagnosis is important [1].Diagnosis may be reached by transabdominal ultrasound, however, correct interpretation and location of the multiple compartments of the abdominal wall, especially in pregnant women, may be difficult [15, 19]. Although a CT scan is the gold standard in acute hematomas, a MRI scan poses a viable diagnostic alternative and should always be considered in combination with ultrasound in pregnant patients.After diagnosis, a conservative therapy should be conducted. If the patient presents with hemodynamic instability and a profound bleeding is detected, invasive therapy is indispensable and reduces mortality and morbidity for the mother and the fetus [20] (Fig. 3).                                          Fig. 3                        Flow chart for acute abdominal pain in a pregnant woman. Rectus sheath hematoma: clinical features, diagnostics and therapy. CTG cardiotocography, FFP fresh frozen plasma, Hb hemoglobin, HELLP hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, I.v. intravenousSeveral cases in the literature report uneventful, spontaneous vaginal delivery after RSH [22, 23]. Although a previous RSH in a patient’s medical history increases her risk of recurrence, spontaneous vaginal delivery seems to be safe and justifiable under intensified intrapartum and postpartum controls. According to this and with our patient’s consent, we planned a spontaneous vaginal delivery which proved uneventful.CONCLUSION:To depict the relevant anatomical structures for the pathogenesis of RSH, we performed a cadaver study using formalin-fixed bodies of cadaver donors.The rectus sheath forms a central part of the anterior abdominal wall. It connects the xiphoid process and the costal cartilages of the fifth, sixth and the seventh rib with the os pubis and contains two muscles: the rectus abdominis and the pyramidalis muscle.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-016-0972-x;Use of sugammadex in parotid surgery: a case report;;;INTRODUCTION: Parotid surgery is a common ear, nose, and throat procedure. Facial nerve paralysis is the main feared complication following this surgery. To avoid this paralysis, intraoperative facial nerve monitoring is often used, but neuromuscular blocking agents interfere with this technique. Therefore, the neuromuscular blocking agent used should have a short duration of muscle relaxation. With the discovery of sugammadex, a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent has acquired the potential to be used in place of succinylcholine.CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old African woman was scheduled for a parotidectomy at our hospital. Rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block was reversed intraoperatively with sugammadex to facilitate identification of facial nerve function. The facial nerve was identified without incident, and surgical conditions were good for the removal of the tumor. During postoperative follow-up, no evidence of residual paralysis has been noted.CONCLUSION: In parotid surgery, the use of sugammadex allows free use of a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent for intubation and thus intraoperative facial nerve monitoring can be done safely.;INTRODUCTION: Parotid surgery is a common ear, nose, and throat procedure. Transient or permanent facial nerve paralysis during this operation is still the most feared complication [1].Intraoperative use of nerve integrity monitors during parotid surgery has been advocated to reduce the incidence of facial nerve paralysis, but neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) interfere with the use of this technique. Therefore, the NMBA used should induce a short duration of muscle relaxation. Previously, the choice was limited to succinylcholine, which has some undesirable side effects, such as the risk of anaphylaxis, increased serum potassium levels, and other cardiovascular complications [2, 3]. The use of an anesthetic protocol without muscle relaxants might be responsible for difficult intubation, hemodynamic changes, and laryngeal complications.With the discovery of sugammadex, steroidal NMBA has acquired the potential to be used in place of succinylcholine in parotid surgery with intraoperative facial nerve monitoring (IFNM). The use of sugammadex could allow better intubating conditions with better intraoperative identification of facial nerves, especially where contraindications to succinylcholine such as hyperkalemia, exist. This is the second report in the literature of parotid surgery in which rocuronium was administered and later antagonized with sugammadex for IFNM.CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old African woman weighing 72 kg and 169 cm tall, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I, was referred to our hospital because of tumefaction of the neck. Her clinical examination revealed an isolated parotid mass without associated lymphadenopathy. She had no pain or peripheral facial nerve palsy. The magnetic resonance imaging results were in favor of a pleomorphic adenoma (Figs. 1 and 2), and the patient was scheduled for a parotidectomy with general anesthesia.                                      Fig. 1                      Axial T1-weighted image with hypointensity showing the tumor process of the right parotid gland                                                          Fig. 2                      Coronal enhancement after gadolinium injectionThe results of the patient’s cardiovascular examination were normal, with a noninvasive blood pressure of 131/71 mmHg and a heart rate of 79 beats/minute. Her respiratory examination revealed no dyspnea or snoring. Her oxygen saturation was 98 % on room air. An examination of her upper airway demonstrated good opening of the mouth and good mobility of the cervical spine (Mallampati class I). Her laboratory test results were a urea plasma concentration of 0.18 g/L, a creatinine level of 6 mg/L, blood glucose level of 0.99 mg/dl, hemoglobin concentration of 15.1 g/dl, platelet count of 213,000/mm3, prothrombin time of 12.9 seconds, and international normalized ratio of 1.2. Her chest x-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG) were unremarkable.After written informed consent was obtained from the patient, it was decided to use general anesthesia during the procedure. Upon the patient’s arrival in the operating theater, intravenous access was established and standard anesthesia monitoring (three-lead ECG, peripheral oxygen saturation, noninvasive blood pressure) was instituted.Neuromuscular monitoring was performed using acceleromyography. Following calibration, the ulnar nerve was supramaximally stimulated with a square pulse of 0.2-ms duration delivered as train-of-four (TOF) pulses at intervals of 15 seconds. The resulting contractions of the adductor pollicis muscles were quantified by using an acceleromyographic monitor (Infinity® Trident® NMT SmartPod®, Dräger, Lübeck, Germany). The TOF ratio and time interval from injection of the reversal agent to TOF ratio 0.9 were recorded.Before induction of anesthesia, midazolam 2 mg was administered intravenously as premedication. After 5 minutes of adequate preoxygenation, anesthesia was initiated with fentanyl (2.5 μg/kg) and propofol (3 mg/kg) without significant hemodynamic changes. To facilitate tracheal intubation, rocuronium (0.5 mg/kg) was administered after effective mask ventilation. Once there was no twitching in response to TOF stimulation (1 minute, 45 seconds), the patient’s airway was successfully secured after the first attempt with a 7.0-mm endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube was connected to a closed “low-flow” anesthetic breathing circuit. Ventilation was controlled to maintain normocapnia with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/minute, and peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (1 %) in a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (50 %:50 %). The end-tidal concentrations of anesthetic and carbon dioxide were measured continuously using a multiple gas monitor. The depth of anesthesia was monitored by bispectral index (BIS), and body temperature was maintained using heating blankets. The patient was placed in supine position and with slight Trendelenburg tilting of the table and the patient’s head turned to the left side. A bolus dose of fentanyl was administered before starting the skin incision to maintain a BIS score between 40 and 60. After the surgical incision was made (15 minutes after induction), there was no response on the basis of TOF ratio. Neuromuscular block was reversed with sugammadex (4 mg/kg). The TOF reached 0.9 after 5 minutes. No hemodynamic or respiratory changes were noted. We stopped the neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring after obtaining a TOF ratio above 0.9 in three consecutive measurements.The inspired isoflurane concentration was gradually increased to 1.8 % to prevent movement during critical phases of the surgical procedure after reversing neuromuscular blockade. The parotid gland was carefully dissected under magnification with facial nerve monitoring. The facial nerve was identified using the NIM 2.4 nerve integrity monitoring system (MEDTRONIC-XOMED, Jacksonville, FL, USA), and after 1 h surgical conditions were good for the removal of the tumor.The patient was extubated when fully awake after a smooth emergence from anesthesia. Her oxygen saturation was 99 % with 2 L/minute of supplemental oxygen. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and no evidence of facial nerve paralysis was noted in the postinterventional surveillance room. The patient was discharged to home after 5 days of hospitalization.DISCUSSION: Facial nerve palsy remains a serious complication after parotid surgery [1, 4]. It is feared by the surgical team and has a negative emotional and functional impact on the patient. The incidence of temporary facial nerve dysfunction may be quite high, with some authors reporting occurrence in up to 76 % of patients. Permanent facial nerve paralysis occurs much less frequently, some authors have reported rates of approximately 4–5 % [5, 6]. Risk factors for facial nerve injury include advanced age, inflammatory diseases of the parotid gland, duration of surgery, revision surgery, extent of surgery, and malignancy [5, 7–9].Positive identification and preservation of the facial nerve is the key to preventing inadvertent facial nerve injury. IFNM has been advocated to reduce the incidence of facial nerve paralysis in parotid surgery. The technique is used for assessing the anatomic and functional integrity of nerves during parotid surgery and can be valuable in the presence of a high risk of nerve injury. This method requires intact NMT. However, the value of the procedure may be limited by the administration of NMBAs, which are required to prevent tracheal and/or laryngeal damage, difficult intubation, and hemodynamic changes during endotracheal intubation [10, 11]. To minimize the effect of this neuromuscular blockade, short-acting NMBAs such as succinylcholine and rocuronium were used. Succinylcholine has some undesirable side effects, such as the risk of anaphylaxis, increased serum potassium levels, and other cardiovascular complications [2, 3].An alternative method is to use a nondepolarizing neuromuscular block, however, without reversal, waiting for a spontaneous recovery may be time-consuming and can potentially prolong the surgery. Before the introduction of sugammadex into clinical practice, neuromuscular block was routinely antagonized with neostigmine. This agent inactivates acetylcholinesterase, which is responsible for breakdown of acetylcholine and for displacing NMBAs to acetylcholine from the nicotinic receptors. Because NMBAs have a longer duration of action than cholinesterase inhibitors, there is a risk of recurarization. This explains why antagonism of intense blockade may be inefficient after neostigmine administration. Neostigmine is also associated with an increased risk for muscarinergic side effects, and parasympatholytic anticholinergic drugs such as atropine or glycopyrrolate need to be added. Another inconvenience is its substantial variability of action [12].Sugammadex has been suggested as a superior alternative. It is a modified γ-cyclodextrin specifically developed for rapid reversal of a rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade achieved by forming a stable and inactive complex and completely encapsulating these agents. Up to 90 % of the sugammadex dose is excreted within 24 h. Overall, 96 % of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which at least 95 % could be attributed to unchanged sugammadex. Administration of sugammadex to healthy volunteers resulted in increased renal elimination of rocuronium in complex with sugammadex. This results in reducing the amount of NMBAs available to bind to nicotinic receptors in the neuromuscular junction and in the reversal of neuromuscular blockade. This particular mechanism allows safe and effective antagonizing that can be applied at any time during the neuromuscular block by increasing doses of sugammadex. It is also devoid of the risks of neostigmine and has better efficacy at reversal. A phase III, active-controlled, randomized study proved that, compared with neostigmine, sugammadex provides significantly faster reversal of a deep rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade [13]. In our patient, sugammadex was administered at a TOF count of 0. The time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was 5 minutes, which allowed IFNM to be conducted. Sugammadex was given in a 4 mg∙kg−1 dose. Fabregat et al. reported two patients [14] in whom the sugammadex dosage was seemingly lower than the one we used. Rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block was reversed with sugammadex 0.22 mg∙kg−1 when the TOF ratio was 0.14 in the first patient, and with sugammadex 2 mg∙kg−1 during intense block (posttetanic count = 0) in the second patient. The times to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 were 5 minutes and 6 minutes, 15 seconds, respectively.We chose to completely reverse neuromuscular block using sugammadex 4 mg∙kg−1 for different reasons. The use of IFNM alone does not guarantee preservation of facial nerve function. An important factor is the experience of the surgery team. The surgery was done by experienced surgeons who are known to reach the facial nerve very early with a significantly shorter interval between skin incision and facial nerve identification. This explains why sugammadex was administered earlier in the surgery at a deeper level of blockade. In addition, the nerve in such cases is chronically compressed by the tumor and may be more sensitive to the effects of neuromuscular blockade.CONCLUSION:Because of the importance of the facial nerve, its preservation is a central goal of parotid surgery. Rapid reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block by sugammadex, coupled with the analysis of neuromuscular blockade with the TOF method and IFNM, ensured the preservation of neuromuscular function and created optimal conditions for the surgical team in this case.;

Acquired renal arteriovenous malformation (arteriovenous fistulae) accounts for approximately 70% of renal arteriovenous abnormalities. Congenital renal arteriovenous malformation, relatively rare, can result in significant hematuria which may require arterial embolization or nephrectomy.CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Asian man presented to the Urology department in our hospital with gradual left scrotal swelling for 2 years. Ultrasound and computed tomography showed an irregular mass in the upper pole of his left kidney. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed cirsoid-type left renal arteriovenous malformation combined with left renal vein ostial stenosis. After digital subtraction angiography and selective segmental renal artery embolization, the varicocele was obviously alleviated.CONCLUSION: The etiology diagnosis of varicocele is not always straightforward, and renal arteriovenous malformation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of varicocele and renal mass. Renal arteriovenous malformation is difficult to distinguish from renal tumor according to varicocele and computed tomography presentation, while magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography help to make a definite diagnosis and selective renal angiographic embolization is one of the best treatments for renal arteriovenous malformation.;INTRODUCTION: Renal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an aberrant vascular connection between the renal artery and vein. AVM can be either acquired or congenital. Acquired renal AVM (arteriovenous fistulae, AVF) accounts for approximately 70% of renal arteriovenous abnormalities and usually results from trauma, biopsy, surgery, or inflammation. Congenital renal AVM, relatively rare, can result in significant hematuria which may require arterial embolization or nephrectomy [1]. Other presentations including hypertension of unknown cause, abdominal pain, cardiac failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy are also usually associated with AVM [2]. Varicocele is present in 15% of adult men, and is a rare symptom of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus [3, 4].We report a case that presented as severe varicocele, and suspicious malignant renal mass was suggested by computed tomography (CT). The case did not show the typical symptoms of renal AVM including hematuria, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac failure, abdominal pain, or flank pain, which increased the difficulty of diagnosis. This patient was finally diagnosed as having renal AVM combined with renal vein ostial stenosis after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and selective renal arteriography were conducted. Therefore, varicocele could be a suspicious presentation for asymptomatic renal AVM, which requires the confirmation of renal arteriography.CASE PRESENTATION: In September 2015, a 64-year-old Asian man presented to our Urology department with gradual left scrotal swelling for 2 years. His medical history included hypertension treated by orally administered Plendil (felodipine) and Acertil (perindopril), and diabetes treated by orally administered Amaryl (glimepiride) for 10 years, and hepatitis B treated by orally administered nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs). His medical history did not include renal injury, renal biopsy, or percutaneous nephrolithotomy. He was born in Nanjing, China, and grew up in the city proper of Nanjing. His occupation is civil servant, he did not smoke tobacco or consume alcohol. No familial genetic disorder of our patient was found. On admission, his blood pressure was 141/92 mmHg, heart rate was 85 beats/minute, body temperature was 37.1 °C, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. A physical examination showed grade 3 left varicocele (Fig. 1a). No abnormality was found in a neurological examination. Blood chemical analyses are shown in Table 1. A urine analysis revealed urine glucose level of 2+, while other indexes including white blood cell count (3.5/ul) and red blood cell count (4.5/ul) were in the normal range. Ultrasound showed a low echo mass with fluent blood flow in the upper pole of his left kidney and bilateral varicocele (diameter, 2.7 mm for right side and 4.5 mm for left side). Ultrasound also showed a low echo of 3.7 × 4.2 cm in the upper pole of his left kidney, with affluent blood flow signals.

CT demonstrated left-side varicocele (Fig. 3d), a space-occupying lesion sized 3.6 × 4.3 cm in the upper pole of left kidney, and early enhanced dilated left renal vein with its ostial stenosis (Fig. 3b). CT also showed an unusual dilated vessel derived from left kidney and dilated lumbar vein in arterial phase, which demonstrated a local AVF (Fig. 3a and c). Axial T2-weighted MRI demonstrated large abnormal early flow voids within this mass, suggesting a vascular lesion (Fig. 1c). Selective right renal arteriography confirmed a cirsoid-type renal AVM by demonstrating abnormal arterial communication with vein in the upper pole with premature visualization of the dilated venous system, which included renal vein, lumbar vein, and his left gonadal vein (Fig. 2). Two arterial feeders arising from apical and upper segmental artery of his left kidney supply the renal AVM. He underwent selective renal artery embolization (Fig. 3e). His varicocele was alleviated obviously after selective embolization, and no relapse or abnormal blood chemical analyses were found during a follow-up time of 12 months.

Renal AVF usually results from trauma, biopsy, surgery, or inflammation, and the presentations of renal AVF include hematuria, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac failure, abdominal pain, and flank pain [2, 6]. However, no relevant medical history or hematuria is observed in this case, although hematuria is the most common symptom of patients with renal AVF [7]. Therefore, this individual is considered an atypical case of congenital renal AVM with no hematuria. Varicocele is the primary presentation of our case. Several reported cases showed right-sided varicocele as a presentation of right renal tumor [8, 9]. An acute nontraumatic varicocele, especially on the left side, may also indicate the presence of a retroperitoneal mass [10]. In a case with varicocele, the symptom recurred after subinguinal varicocelectomy, and RCC was definitely diagnosed by histology after a radical nephrectomy [11]. However, varicocele is a rare symptom of RCC with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus, although ultrasound and CT could make the diagnosis of retroperitoneal or renal tumor in most cases [12]. Cirsoid renal AVM may be misdiagnosed as renal tumor [13, 14] or renal pelvis tumor [1] due to its remarkable similarity with renal tumor in radiological presentation. CT findings of renal AVM are commonly characterized by masses of renal sinus vascular density, which surround the pelvicaliceal system [15]. It might be very difficult to confirm the diagnosis when irregular masses in the renal parenchyma are shown by CT. A low density area in contrast-enhanced CT was suspected to indicate ischemic renal parenchyma due to the steal phenomenon of renal AVM [14]. The patient in our study presented with varicocele and renal mass, which further complicated the case. MRI may help to differentiate renal AVM from renal tumor. However, if imaged during a delayed phase after gadolinium administration, it may be difficult to differentiate an AVM from an enhancing solid renal sinus mass [16]. In this case, MRI showed a tangle of enlarged vessels and early draining vein in his left kidney, which was consistent with renal AVM [16].Multiple arteriovenous communications, produced by a cluster of tortuous arterial and venous structures, are the main characteristics of the cirsoid-type of AVM. The preoperative diagnosis of renal cirsoid AVM is generally made with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). On angiographic examination, renal cirsoid AVM is revealed as multiple, tortuous vascular channels supplied by segmental arterial branches [17].Angiographic embolization (AE) is being used with increasing frequency due to minimal invasion, fewer complications, and preservation of the renal function [18]. Clinically, observation is the main treatment of renal AVM in asymptomatic cases. Embolization, partial nephrectomy, and selective arterial ligation are also choices for those cases with a variety of symptoms [19, 20]. In our case, selective embolization according to previously described criteria [21] preserved most of the renal parenchyma instead of nephrectomy. Our patient has been followed up for 26 months and the regression of varicocele was observed at 6 months postoperation, and no sign of relapse of the AVM was observed.CONCLUSION:In conclusion, the etiology diagnosis of varicocele is not always straightforward, and renal AVM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of varicocele and renal mass. Renal AVM is difficult to distinguish from renal tumor according to varicocele and CT presentation, while MRI and DSA help to make a definite diagnosis and selective renal AE is one of the best treatments for renal AVM.;
https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-9-16;A case of type B lactic acidosis as a complication of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia: a case report and review of the literature;;AML: Acute myeloid leukaemia, CMML: Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, GCS: Glasgow Coma Scale, ICU: Intensive Care Unit, IGF: Insulin-like growth factor, LA: Lactic acidosis, PDH: Pyruvate dehydrogenase, TNFα: Tumour necrosis factor alpha.;INTRODUCTION: Type B lactic acidosis represents a rare and often lethal complication of haematological malignancy. Here, we present a patient who developed a type B lactic acidosis presumably due to a concurrent chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Upon swift initiation of cytoreductive chemotherapy (doxorubicin), the lactic acidosis was rapidly brought under control. This case adds to the literature reporting other haematological malignancies that can cause a type B lactic acidosis and its successful treatment.CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian man brought to our Accident and Emergency department following an unwitnessed collapse, he was found surrounded by coffee-ground vomit. Although haemodynamically stable on admission, he rapidly deteriorated as his lactic acid rose. An initial arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.27 and lactate of 18mmol/L (peaking at 21mmol/L).CONCLUSION: A high degree of clinical suspicion for haematological malignancy should be held when presented with a patient with lactic acidosis in clinical practice, even without evidence of poor oxygenation or another cause. Treatment with emergency chemotherapy, in lieu of a definitive diagnosis, was rapidly successful at lowering lactate levels within 8 hours. This may suggest a causal and perhaps direct relationship between lactic acid production and the presence of leukemic cells. Veno-venous haemofiltration had no apparent effect on reducing the lactic acidosis and therefore its benefit is questioned in this setting, especially at the cost of delaying chemotherapy. In the face of a life-threatening lactic acidosis, pragmatic clinical judgement alone may justify the rapid initiation of chemotherapy.;INTRODUCTION: Lactate is the metabolic product of anaerobic glycolytic metabolism [1]. The sole route for lactate removal is its oxidative conversion back into pyruvate. Under normal conditions lactate clearance occurs primarily by the liver (80 to 90%) and kidneys [2]. However, lactic acidosis (LA) arises from a disruption in the balance between the production and breakdown of lactate. The state of LA has been defined as a pH of ≤7.35 and a plasma lactate concentration of ≥5mEq/L (≥5mmol/L) [3].LA was originally divided into two categories by Cohen and Woods: type A and type B [4]. They associated type A with clinical evidence of a state of poor tissue oxygenation (for example shock, hypoxaemia), with the acidosis driven by either the overproduction or underutilisation of lactate. In type B there is no clinical evidence of inadequate tissue oxygen delivery which is associated with sepsis, malignancy, diabetes, thiamine deficiency and liver disease [5]. It represents a rare and often lethal complication of haematological malignancy. Recent theories pertaining to its origin include a shift to glycolysis by malignant cells and an impairment of lactate conversion by renal and hepatic metabolism. Friedenberg et al. [6] reported that 67 cases of type B LA have been cited in the literature to date [6]. Using the same search terms (performing a MEDLINE and PubMed – National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA – search with the key words “type B lactic acidosis” and “leukaemia” or “lymphoma”, all years), we were able to identify a further nine individual cases [1, 2, 7–12], including our own.Here, we present the rare case of a patient who developed a type B LA presumably due to concurrent chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). No case to date has identified this association without the context of sepsis or transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) [6, 9]. Clinical uncertainty arose over the cause of the LA due to the paucity of literature on this association. This is likely to have contributed to a delay in the initiation of cytoreductive chemotherapy (doxorubicin) as a treatment option. When initiated, however, in lieu of a definitive diagnosis and without a benefit from haemofiltration, a single dose of doxorubicin was rapidly successful at lowering lactate levels within 8 hours (Figure 1).                                      Figure 1                      Serum lactate levels were dramatically raised from admission until the initiation of doxorubicin. Haemofiltration had no apparent effect on lactate levels. Lactate remained raised throughout admission, normal range is 0.4 to 1.7mmol/L, potentially due to a suspected subacute gastrointestinal bleed. CCVHF, continuous veno-venous haemofiltration.CASE PRESENTATION: This is the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian man who presented to our Accident and Emergency department after he was discovered collapsed and surrounded by coffee-ground vomit (Table 1). Over the last 6 weeks, there had been a history of generalised malaise, anorexia, rapid weight loss, as well as epigastric pain and vomiting following meals (treated in general practice with ranitidine 150mg, once daily). There was no significant past medical history aside from long-standing, well-controlled, hypertension (atenolol 50mg and losartan 50mg, both once daily). No abnormalities were found on examination, including melena. A computed tomography scan (head) demonstrated a concomitant chronic subdural haematoma with midline shift of unknown cause. Initial differential diagnoses included a gastric malignancy, myelodysplasia and an upper gastrointestinal bleed.Table 1                                              Timeline                                          Previous 6 weeks:generalised malaise, anorexia, rapid weight loss, as well as epigastric pain and vomiting following mealsDay 1:Admission to Accident and Emergency with collapse and coffee-ground vomit, transfer to Intensive Care UnitDay 2 (02:00):Continuous veno-venous haemofiltration institutedDay 2 (14:00):Doxorubicin (50mg, intravenous, once), rasburicase and Pabrinex® (vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid and nicotinamide) administeredDay 2 (15:00)Plasma lactate peaks at 21.0mmol/LDay 3 (20:00)Plasma lactate plateaus at approximately 4mmol/LDay 7:Transferred to haematologyDay 15:Surgical evacuation of haematomaDay 16:Transfer to Neurological Intensive Care UnitDay 20:Withdrawal of care in patient’s best interestsDay 21:Patient dies, 02.17 a.m.On admission, he was Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 14, temperature was 36.7°C, heart rate was 110 beats/minute, arterial blood pressure 152/50mmHg, with respiratory rate of 23 and a blood oxygen saturation of 99% self-ventilating on 21% oxygen. An initial arterial blood gas revealed a lactate of 18mmol/L, bicarbonate of 11mmol/L and a base excess of −19 (pH 7.27): a LA. His delta ratio was 1.9:1 consistent with a pure LA in which the delta ratio averages 1.6:1. This result and a rapid physiological decline prompted admission to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU).His initial blood film demonstrated features of myelodysplastic syndrome (dysplasia, thrombocytopenia, occasional blast cells), white cell count 25.48×109/L, neutrophils 9.98, lymphocytes 2.4, and monocytes 7.58. Antibiotics were given as per the local protocol for neutropenic sepsis: Tazocin® (piperacillin-tazobactam) and gentamicin. While sepsis was not entirely discounted, blood cultures were negative and a chest radiograph revealed no abnormalities. After 6 hours of ICU admission, continuous veno-venous haemofiltration was instituted for the first 60 hours of admission. A bone marrow aspirate was compatible with CMML but suggested no acute transformation to AML. Despite initial reservations to ascribe the cause of the LA to the haematological malignancy, emergency chemotherapy (doxorubicin, 50mg, intravenous, once) was instituted, alongside rasburicase and empiric intravenous Pabrinex® (vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid and nicotinamide) therapy. His lactic acid peaked at 21mmol/L (Figure 1) 1 hour after (15:00 hours) and had plateaued at a nadir of approximately 4mmol/L by 20:00 hours the next day (Figure 1). Thiamine levels were retrospectively reported as 458nmol/L. Initial results suggested no liver or renal dysfunction: creatinine (123mmol/L) and urea (22.5mmol/L), alanine transaminase (20U/L), aspartate transaminase (91U/L) and albumin (47g/L).On day seven, he was transferred to haematology awaiting leukocyte and platelet counts to recover. After 11 days, the decision was made to surgically evacuate his subdural haematoma to give the best chance for a neurological recovery (GCS fluctuated, with a baseline of nine). Post-surgery, he showed minimal improvement in our Neurological ICU. The decision was made, with the family, to withdraw care on day 21.DISCUSSION: Despite the severity of type B LA, little is known about its pathophysiological basis and there is no consensus on empirical treatment [2]. Review of the case literature reveals it to be a well-recognised phenomenon, despite its rarity, highlighting the need for development of clinical practice aimed at the rapid diagnosis and treatment of this condition.Lactate is converted to and from pyruvate in the liver and kidney. In acidosis, the renal clearance of lactate predominates as hepatic uptake is significantly impaired. At pH 7.45 the kidneys clear 16% of lactate, whereas at pH 6.75 this rises to approximately 44%, compensating for half of the reduced hepatic function [13, 14]. Hence, metabolic impairment of these organs either by ischaemic damage or neoplastic infiltration could precipitate an impediment of lactate clearance [5]. Despite inconsistent laboratory or radiographic findings, metabolic disruption is a common occurrence among patients with haematological malignancies and those on critical care wards. However, type B LA and liver or renal failure do not always coexist (neither were apparent in our case), therefore another mechanism must also contribute to LA.The Warburg effect is the observation that tumour cells favour glycolysis instead of oxidative metabolism, even at normal oxygen concentrations (‘aerobic glycolysis’) [15]. This fact underlies the near 90% sensitivity and specificity of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [16]. Although a relatively inefficient metabolic process, it is hypothesised the glycolytic phenotype initially arises as an adaption to local hypoxia [16]. Likewise, hypoxic pressure may also arise due to the impaired perfusion of healthy tissues either by solid tumour infiltrate or leukemic micro-emboli [6].Hexokinase and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are regularly overexpressed in malignant cells and promote glycolysis [3]. Hexokinase catalyses the initial rate-limiting step in glycolysis and when present at high concentrations can promote glycolytic metabolism, even in the presence of oxygen. In addition, IGFs can mimic insulin, an activator of hexokinase. Similarly, the role of the hypoxia-inducible factor genes, which allow cellular adaption to hypoxia can upregulate glycolysis and are known to drive neoplastic growth in some tumour types (for example Von Hippel–Lindau disease) [5]. Nevertheless, the promotion of aerobic glycolysis in haematological malignancies may precipitate uncontrollable lactate production.A shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism may also be mediated by inflammatory cytokines released by, and in response to, haematological malignancy. For example, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is often correlated to plasma lactate concentration and have been shown to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) [3]. However, the causal relationship between TNFα and LA has not been elucidated, for example, in vitro hyperlacticacidemia itself has been shown to promote the transcription of TNFα [17]. PDH is an important enzyme in the production of acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle and ultimately drives the electron transport chain as part of oxidative respiration. Disruption of this process may drive lactate production and, ultimately, LA [6].Another described mechanism postulates deficiencies in thiamine may drive LA. Thiamine is required for PDH enzymatic activity [18]. One case reported reversal of LA with thiamine supplementation to a patient receiving total parenteral nutrition [19].In sepsis, with rapid leukocyte production, excessive pyruvate and lactate production occurs due to an accelerated glycolytic rate, independent of anaerobic glycolysis and impairment of PDH [20]. Lactate is produced by leukocytes, which have few mitochondria and little capacity to metabolise pyruvate aerobically [21]. Haematological malignancies could conceivably drive LA by similar mechanisms. Likewise, a high rate of cellular apoptosis may also drive compensatory glycolysis due to a loss of mitochondrial function, for example, this occurs in tumour lysis syndrome [6, 22].On the premise that neoplastic cells are driving the type B LA, cytoreductive chemotherapy is the most widely used therapeutic strategy. Our report and other clinical data in the literature are supportive of this, as resolution of LA often occurs with treatment and reoccurs with a relapse of malignancy [23–26]. While this occurred in this case within 7 hours of doxorubicin administration, causality cannot be definitely determined. A repeat bone marrow aspiration or blood film was not performed, with reduction of leukemic status only being inferred from the full blood count.The benefit of empiric Pabrinex® (vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid and nicotinamide) therapy is unknown, although the patient was not deficient in thiamine on testing. Haemodialysis aimed at removing excess lactate has shown some efficacy as an adjunct to chemotherapy, although its efficacy remains controversial [27]. No liver or renal dysfunction was apparent in this case. Despite haemodialysis, the lactate levels of our patient remained stubbornly high, peaking at 21mmol/L. The persistent elevation of his lactate was possibly due to a suspected concurrent gastrointestinal bleed. Therefore, the contributory effect of haemodialysis in this case, as well as treating type B LA in general, may be questioned.CONCLUSION:Lactate is converted to and from pyruvate in the liver and kidney. In acidosis, the renal clearance of lactate predominates as hepatic uptake is significantly impaired. At pH 7.45 the kidneys clear 16% of lactate, whereas at pH 6.75 this rises to approximately 44%, compensating for half of the reduced hepatic function [13, 14].

Likewise, hypoxic pressure may also arise due to the impaired perfusion of healthy tissues either by solid tumour infiltrate or leukemic micro-emboli [6].Hexokinase and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are regularly overexpressed in malignant cells and promote glycolysis [3]. Hexokinase catalyses the initial rate-limiting step in glycolysis and when present at high concentrations can promote glycolytic metabolism, even in the presence of oxygen. In addition, IGFs can mimic insulin, an activator of hexokinase. Similarly, the role of the hypoxia-inducible factor genes, which allow cellular adaption to hypoxia can upregulate glycolysis and are known to drive neoplastic growth in some tumour types (for example Von Hippel–Lindau disease) [5]. Nevertheless, the promotion of aerobic glycolysis in haematological malignancies may precipitate uncontrollable lactate production.A shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism may also be mediated by inflammatory cytokines released by, and in response to, haematological malignancy. For example, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is often correlated to plasma lactate concentration and have been shown to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) [3]. However, the causal relationship between TNFα and LA has not been elucidated, for example, in vitro hyperlacticacidemia itself has been shown to promote the transcription of TNFα [17]. PDH is an important enzyme in the production of acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle and ultimately drives the electron transport chain as part of oxidative respiration. Disruption of this process may drive lactate production and, ultimately, LA [6].Another described mechanism postulates deficiencies in thiamine may drive LA. Thiamine is required for PDH enzymatic activity [18]. One case reported reversal of LA with thiamine supplementation to a patient receiving total parenteral nutrition [19].In sepsis, with rapid leukocyte production, excessive pyruvate and lactate production occurs due to an accelerated glycolytic rate, independent of anaerobic glycolysis and impairment of PDH [20]. Lactate is produced by leukocytes, which have few mitochondria and little capacity to metabolise pyruvate aerobically [21]. Haematological malignancies could conceivably drive LA by similar mechanisms. Likewise, a high rate of cellular apoptosis may also drive compensatory glycolysis due to a loss of mitochondrial function, for example, this occurs in tumour lysis syndrome [6, 22].;
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-018-1572-8;Apple, condom, and cocaine – body stuffing in prison: a case report;;CT: Computed tomography, ED: Emergency Department, GI: Gastrointestinal, PPI: Proton pump inhibitor;INTRODUCTION: Drug dealers and drug users resort to body stuffing to hastily conceal illicit drugs by ingesting their drug packets. This practice represents a medical challenge because rupture of the often insecure packaging can be toxic and even lethal. In an emergency setting, official guidelines are needed to help the medical team decide on the proper treatment. A preliminary observation period is generally accepted but its duration varies from hours to eventual packet expulsion.CASE PRESENTATION: This case involves a 20-year-old white man in detention who claimed to have ingested one cocaine packet wrapped in plastic food-wrap and a condom in anticipation of an impending cell search. He reached out to medical professionals on day 4 after having unsuccessfully tried several methods to expel the drug packet, including swallowing olive oil, natural laxatives, liters of water, and 12 carved apple chunks. An initial computed tomography scan confirmed multiple packet-sized images throughout his stomach and bowel. After 24 hours of observation and normal bowel movements without expelling any packets, a subsequent scan found only one air-lined packet afloat in the gastric content. Due to the prolonged retention of the package there was an increased risk of rupture. The packet was eventually removed by laparoscopic gastrotomy.CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates that observation time needs to be adapted to each individual case of body stuffing. Proof of complete drug package evacuation ensures secure patient discharge. Body stuffers should be routinely asked for a detailed history, including how the drug is wrapped, and whether or not they ingested other substances to help expel the packets. The history enables the accurate interpretation of imaging. Repeated imaging can help follow the progress of packets if not all have been expelled during the observation period. Drug packets should be surgically removed in case of prolonged retention. To ensure the best possible outcomes, patients should have access to high-quality, private, and confidential medical care, which is equal to that offered to the general population. This is paramount to earning trust and collaboration from people in detention who resort to body stuffing.;INTRODUCTION: Body stuffers, who are at the end of the drug trafficking chain as community drug dealers or consumers, swallow the few drug packets that they have on hand (mostly cocaine and heroin) to conceal them from law enforcement in anticipation of impending searches or arrest [1]. In contrast, body packers usually ingest a large number of mechanically manufactured compact drug packets enclosed in multiple layers of wrapping to resist rupture during long-distance drug smuggling [2].When taken to a medical facility, an unenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan is usually preformed and is preferred to conventional X-ray for confirmation of the diagnosis [3–5]. Body stuffers are then usually observed for a few hours and released if no complications occur [6]. However, the required duration of the observation is still debated with some authors recommending discharge after 6 hours of unremarkable observation, and others recommending a conservative approach, which consists of waiting for the evacuation of the drug packets by unaided bowel movements (no medication, such as prokinetic agents or laxatives) [7, 8]. The use of oil-based laxatives is not recommended as it can cause packet rupture due to a chemical reaction with latex [9]. However, if patients do not spontaneously expel the packets after a few days, especially if these were loosely wrapped and not intended for internal concealment, they will require further medical attention due to the increased risk of rupture. This is true even if reported body stuffer fatalities are rare and the quantity of ingested drugs is usually less than that of body packers [10–12]. However, packet rupture is dangerous and can be lethal [13, 14]. Surgery is the recommended choice to safely remove retained drug packets versus endoscopy in which the manipulation of packets increases the risk of rupture [15–17].We present this case report to shed light on some of the particular and confusing circumstances that can be found when managing body stuffers. Our report demonstrates that a 6-hour observation period can be insufficient and that CT findings must be correlated with the patient’s story in order to determine the severity of the situation.CASE PRESENTATION: This case involves a 20-year-old healthy white man incarcerated in a detention center in Geneva, Switzerland. He had no medical or mental health conditions and did not take any medication. He has two older siblings, had dropped out of school at a young age, and was living with his mother at the time of incarceration. He used to smoke tobacco and cannabis, which he stopped 2 years ago, consumed cocaine and ecstasy (methylene-dioxymethamphetamine) until 6 months before his incarceration, and drank alcohol occasionally without reporting any binge drinking. Due to a recent trauma to his left wrist, he was accompanied to our University Hospital for an X-ray. Once in Radiology, he confessed to the technician that he had ingested an illicit drug packet 4 days earlier in anticipation of an impending cell search. The drug packet was reportedly 4 to 5 cm in size, contained 6 to 8 g of cocaine, and was wrapped in a condom and plastic food-wrap. He was worried because he had not yet evacuated the packet and had been experiencing mild epigastric pain for a few hours before his x-ray appointment. He did not have any other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. After the wrist X-ray he was taken to our Emergency Department (ED) for the management of the body stuffing. On admission, his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 131/60 mmHg, heart rate of 74 beats/minute, and temperature of 37.6 °C. He was alert, oriented, calm, and expressed no intention of self-harm. A physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness, but no abdominal rigidity, guarding, rebound tenderness, or evidence of a palpable mass. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, including a cardiopulmonary and a complete neurological examination. Laboratory findings were within normal range, including a complete blood count (hemoglobin of 16.2 g/dL, white cell count of 8.5 G/L, platelet count of 121 G/L), kidney and liver function tests, and a urine analysis. Tests for HIV and hepatitis B were negative. He returned to our Radiology Department where a low-dose abdominal CT scan was performed and revealed multiple foreign bodies of similar aspect throughout his stomach, his duodenum, and his small intestine, all of which were consistent with packets of loosely aggregated drugs (Fig. 1a). There was no sign of GI perforation or obstruction.                                      Fig. 1                      a Multiple intradigestive foreign bodies (arrows) situated in the stomach, the duodenum, and small intestine on computed tomography (coronal view). b Single heterogeneous foreign body (arrow) containing air measuring 3.1 × 3.2 × 4 cm located in the stomach on computed tomography (axial view)He was subsequently admitted to our in-patient Carceral Unit for observation. When confronted with the radiology findings of multiple foreign bodies he insisted on having swallowed only one drug packet. Further exploration revealed that he used various GI-stimulating techniques which had been recommended by his fellow inmates to accelerate the expulsion of his slow-progressing packet. These included drinking large quantities of water (more than 3 L daily), ingesting three to four tablespoons of olive oil daily, a cupful of natural fig-based laxative, and applying warm towels on his “liver.” On day 3 after the packet ingestion and as a last resort, he carved and ingested 12 bite-sized apple chunks with the hope that together they would push the packet through his GI system. Despite all these attempts, he continued to have regular bowel movements once daily without evacuating the packet. The fear of a complication compelled him to seize the opportunity of being brought to the X-ray room to reveal the circumstances of his condition to the radiology technician. Since the apple chunks could have been interpreted as images of loosely compacted drug packets, a second low-dose CT scan was performed the day after his admission (day 5 post-ingestion): the apple chunks were partially digested and the images showed the persistence in his stomach of one foreign body containing air and measuring 3.1 × 3.2 × 4 cm (Fig. 1b).Since the packet had been trapped in his stomach for the past 5 days, the condom wrapping was likely to have been compromised by gastric acidity, thus increasing the risk of rupture. Therefore, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) of esomeprazole was administered intravenously. After discussing management options with our patient, GI specialists recommended using surgery rather than gastric endoscopy in order to extract the drug packet with a minimum of risk. A laparoscopic gastrotomy confirmed a floating packet in the gastric fluid which was removed without complications (Fig. 2). Analysis of the packet after retrieval confirmed that the drug was cocaine. The packet was loosely wrapped in two different materials: a first double layer of plastic food-wrap inserted into a condom which was tied with a knot and folded back to form another layer and secured with an outer knot (Figs. 3 and 4).                                      Fig. 2                      Gastrotomy by laparoscopy showing the packet floating in the stomach (blue arrow)                                                          Fig. 3                      Drug packet tied in a condom with an internal knot (white arrow), the second layer of the condom which was folded back to form another protective layer and tied with an outer knot (blue arrow) was cut open and pulled to the left (yellow arrow)                                                          Fig. 4                      Unwrapped drug packet from a double layer of plastic food-wrap with a positive cocaine identification (in blue)He presented a transitory fever up to 38.8 °C at 48-hours post-surgery but otherwise maintained normal vital signs. He resumed oral intake shortly after surgery and continued the PPI treatment for 2 weeks after surgery to aid healing. He was discharged back to prison on day 4 post-surgery. An out-patient follow-up in the prison health service was unremarkable. He was released from detention 2 months after surgery and further follow-up was not possible.DISCUSSION: This is the case of a 20-year-old man who ingested apple chunks to help with the expulsion of a cocaine packet, which was eventually removed by laparoscopic gastrotomy. It illustrates several points that are necessary to consider for the management of body stuffers.First, contrary to the recommendations of Yamamoto et al., an adequate observation time in a medical setting is necessary even if body stuffers do not show signs of complication during the first 6 hours following packet ingestion [7]. Body stuffers often resort to precarious packaging for hasty concealment. Therefore, care must be organized around this point. They present an increased risk of packet rupture and unpredictable progression through the digestive system resulting in the possibility of delayed toxicity even if no signs of toxicity are observed within the first 6 hours post-ingestion. This case shows that loosely aggregated drugs within a poorly wrapped package with trapped air between the different layers may not have the sufficient density to descend and engage into the pylorus. This is compounded if the patient drinks large amounts of fluids which may facilitate normal transit but will keep the packet buoyant in the stomach. A premature discharge of our patient from the hospital could have resulted in poor outcomes and even death (the estimated weight of 6 to 8 g of cocaine, even with admixture, surpasses the minimum lethal dose of 1.2 g of pure cocaine) [10]. Until now, no official guidelines have been set to determine the correct duration of surveillance of body stuffers. Therefore, we believe that it is essential to incorporate the influence of these different technical parameters into the duration of the observation time and discuss with the patient the risks and benefits of a prolonged surveillance to determine the most appropriate course of action.Second, localizing the number, location, and progression of packets is necessary for clinical management. The detection of internal drug packets must be performed by low-dose CT without contrast rather than by conventional X-ray as CT is superior in providing an accurate and reliable detection of different densities, from low-density to high-density packets and different densities of drug aggregation [18]. However, there can be pitfalls due to foreign bodies of similar density, especially if located in the stomach, which can mimic the images of drug packets, as was the case with the pieces of apple in our case study. The literature reports other swallowed foreign bodies that can resemble drug packets, including scybala (hardened masses of feces), grains, stones, or fruits [19]. A way to differentiate the nature of the ingesta would be to measure the Hounsfield unit on CT, which reflects density. However, density measurements are not completely reliable as the nature of the substance, such as its purity, admixture, and compression, plays a major role in imaging [18]. Therefore, body stuffers should be routinely asked whether they ingested other substances to help expel the packages and their history should help interpret the CT images.Third, latex wrapping warrants some attention. Latex condoms can be used for packaging drugs in body stuffing and less rarely in body packing, where packages are generally manufactured mechanically to ensure robustness. It is well documented that oil-based lubricants have an adverse effect on the physical properties of latex condoms (tensile strength, break at elongation, burst pressure, and volume), which can result in their rupture [9]. Such lubricants are found in laxatives, which is the reason their use is not routinely recommended for accelerating the evacuation of drug packets. Gastric juices are extremely corrosive due to their acidity. Therefore, neutralizing the acidity with a PPI appeared to be an empirically safe way to delay the corrosion and rupture of a condom-wrapped package trapped in the stomach. However, surgical management in our case was the safest option.Fourth, body stuffers usually do not trust authorities and are not prone to admitting their drug concealment to anybody. Therefore, they are at increased risk of complications, even more so if they are already in detention. The Geneva University Hospitals have a long-held tradition of providing health services in the detention centers in the canton of Geneva. These services are independent of the judiciary and prison system and are guided by a human rights-based approach to guarantee free access to a health care provider, equivalence of care, and patient’s consent and confidentiality [20]. The respect of these principles gives confidence to people living in detention toward health care professionals: it enables them to seek help that they trust whenever needed. In our case, the patient reached out to a radiology technician (and not to a prison staff member), and collaborated with the ED and in-patient medical team, knowing that the circumstances of his medical intervention would be known only to the medical team and would not be divulged to the penal authorities.CONCLUSION:This case report illustrates that sufficient observation time in an appropriate medical setting is essential for patients presenting with drug body stuffing. Complete drug package evacuation ensures secure patient discharge. A detailed history is fundamental in body stuffers, including how the drug is wrapped, and whether or not other substances were ingested to help expel the packets. The history must be taken into account in the careful interpretation of CT images, and imaging should be repeated if the progression of the packets is in doubt. Drug packets should be surgically removed in case of retention. To ensure the best possible outcomes, providing access to private, confidential, and high-quality medical care, which is equal to the care offered to the general population, is paramount to gain trust and collaboration from people in detention who resort to body stuffing.;
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-016-0945-0;Non-perforation tension pneumoperitoneum resulting from primary non-aerobic bacterial peritonitis in a previously healthy middle-aged man: a case report;;;INTRODUCTION: Tension pneumoperitoneum is a rare surgical emergency in which free intraperitoneal gas accumulates under pressure. The known sources of free gas are perforated hollow viscera. We believe this is the first published case of a tension non-perforation pneumoperitoneum secondary to anaerobic gas production. This occurred in a background of primary non-aerobic bacterial peritonitis, which developed in an immunocompetent adult man.CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 45-year-old Bulgarian man presented with a 3-week history of abdominal pain. He displayed signs of shock, peritonitis, and abdominal compartment syndrome. A plain abdominal X-ray showed the pathognomonic “saddlebag sign” with his liver displaced downwards and medially. An emergency laparotomy released pressurized gas, accompanied by 3100 mL of foamy pus. A sudden hemodynamic deterioration occurred soon after decompression. The sources of infection and tension pneumoperitoneum were not found. The peritoneal exudate sample did not recover aerobes. A laparostomy was created and three planned re-operations were performed. During the second re-laparotomy we placed an intraperitoneal silo and his abdomen was closed with skin sutures. Definitive fascial closure was achieved through separation of his two rectus muscles from their posterior sheaths. He was discharged in good health on the 25th postoperative day.CONCLUSION: Our case provides evidence supporting the theory that anaerobic infection may underlie the etiology of tension pneumoperitoneum. Prior to decompressive laparotomy the patient should receive an intravenous volume bolus to compensate for possible hypotension. If laparostomy leads to lateralization of the rectus muscles with a gap of 6 cm or less, the posterior part of the components separation technique is effective in achieving fascial closure. We present an original classification of tension pneumoperitoneum defining it as primary or secondary.;INTRODUCTION: Tension pneumoperitoneum (TP) is the accumulation of free gas under pressure within the peritoneal cavity leading to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). The latter is manifested by respiratory failure, which is due to compression of the diaphragm, and obstructive shock, which is the result of compression of the intra-abdominal veins. Compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction can maintain perfusion of vital organs for a limited time. It is pertinent that this situation may be a precursor to an unexpected cardiorespiratory arrest. The diagnosis is based on the clinical signs and symptoms, supported by a plain abdominal X-ray. Radiological findings include pneumoperitoneum, diaphragmatic elevation, downward and medial displacement of the liver (saddlebag sign), with centralization of bowel loops [1]. If TP occurs suddenly, emergency needle decompression is required. It should be followed by laparotomy if gastrointestinal rupture is suspected [2].Seven electronic libraries were browsed to identify English language reports on TP. The period was from 1919 (introduction of abdominal X-ray) until 2015. The search revealed 124 publications with 159 cases of TP. A reference of significance was made by Singer to three German authors (1913 to 1914) who hypothesized that free gas accumulation could be due to gas-producing microorganisms [3]. This theory did not evolve, it was superseded by perforation of a hollow organ and one-way valve explanation of gas entry.Our review revealed that all reported cases were secondary to perforations of hollow viscera. The digestive and respiratory systems were primary locations, with one case originating from the bladder. Of the 159 cases, 127 occurrences of TP were secondary to gastrointestinal perforations caused by: iatrogenic injury, 64, disease, 42, barotrauma and trauma, 11, and surgery, 10. Thirty one cases followed respiratory perforations caused by: iatrogenic injury, 4, barotrauma, 20, blunt chest trauma, 6, and surgery, 1. One case followed a bladder perforation caused by a Foley catheter left open to air. This analysis revealed that the incidence of TP resulting from gastrointestinal perforations was four times higher than those caused by ruptured respiratory organs (Additional file 1: Table S1).We present a case of TP without perforation of a hollow organ. It is without similar reference within the English language literature over a 97-year period.CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old Bulgarian man presented with a vague abdominal pain. The onset of the pain was gradual and had persisted for 3 weeks. He had no comorbidities or surgeries, and did not take medication. His skin was pale, cold, and clammy. His breathing was labored with rapid and shallow respirations. Auscultation of his lungs revealed diminished breath sounds bibasally. His abdomen was bloated, diffusely tender, with guarding and rebound tenderness. Tympanism centrally and dullness laterally were noted on percussion. Bowel sounds were absent.His vital signs on admission were: pulse, 125 minute, blood pressure, 80/40, respiratory rate, 38 minute, oxygen saturation on air, 90 %, and axillary temperature, 35.8 °C.His intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measured via urethral catheter was 26 mmHg. This was a grade IV intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). The amount of urine on catheterization was 50 mL. Blood tests showed anemia, leucocytosis, azotemia, hypoproteinemia, and metabolic acidosis, alpha-amylase was normal. An erect plain X-ray of his abdomen revealed the saddlebag sign (Fig. 1). A chest X-ray disclosed the high position of his diaphragmatic domes, and a small reactive pleural effusion to the right.                                      Fig. 1                      Erect plain abdominal X-ray on admission confirming tension pneumoperitoneum. Large amount of free gas under the right dome of the diaphragm, enveloping the liver (white arrow). The liver is diminished in size and has shifted downwards and medially, resembling a collapsed lung in pneumothorax: “the saddlebag sign” (yellow arrow). Liquid level in the free peritoneal cavity (blue arrow). High position of the right dome of the diaphragm (red arrow). Nasogastric tube (green arrow)He was in shock, with signs of generalized peritonitis and ACS. He received a short course of intravenous fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. This was immediately followed by a midline laparotomy. Upon entering his peritoneal cavity, pressurized gas with a “rotten-egg” odor escaped and 3100 mL of frothy fetid pus evacuated. Despite preoperative rehydration, decompression of the abdomen resulted in sudden hypotension.All of his organs and tissues were uniformly inflamed with no apparent focal site. His intestines were gathered medially in a ball and covered by a “shield” of dense fibrin deposits below which they appeared normal with shiny serosa and non-swollen walls. The appendicular end was indistinguishable from his small bowel loops, and beneath the fibrin shield looked normal. An appendectomy was performed.Systematic exploration of all intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal organs and spaces (including the lesser sac) did not reveal the source of infection. Air-leak testing excluded a ruptured hollow viscus. A sealed perforation was also ruled out. Therefore we concluded that we were dealing with a primary bacterial peritonitis (PBP) of an anaerobic microorganism whose metabolism was responsible for the TP.His abdomen was washed out and left open. His IAP was monitored during the first 48 hours, and fluctuated between 10 and 15 mmHg. Three planned re-laparotomies were performed at 48-hour intervals for debridement, wash out, and exploration for any septic source, none were found. At the end of each re-entry, the laparostomy was partially closed with fascial sutures at both ends. Rapid degradation of the fibrin shield made the bowel loops distinguishable on the second re-entry (Fig. 2). On this occasion there was no danger of ACS with IAP <10 mmHg and no organ dysfunction. Consequently we used the intraperitoneal silo technique by placing a presterilized sheet of cellophane over his intestines. It was tucked into the lateral paracolic gutters, and his abdomen was closed using only skin sutures.                                      Fig. 2                      Second re-laparotomy 4 days after the index operation (picture taken from the patient’s legs). The fibrin “shield” which covered the abdominal organs on the index laparotomy has almost been absorbed, except for the area identified (black arrows). The latter gives a good idea of how the whole abdomen looked on the initial opening. The intestinal loops are already clearly visible (red arrows)On the third re-laparotomy, the silo was removed and the decision was made to definitively close his abdomen. Fascial suture was not possible because the central section remained with an insurmountable gap of 6 cm. We performed the posterior part of the components separation technique (CST) described by Ramirez et al. [4]. Longitudinal incisions of the two posterior rectal sheaths parallel and near his linea alba were made. We bluntly separated these sheaths from his rectus muscles, paying attention not to disturb the neurovascular bundles at the lateral rectal borders. This led to a good mobilization of the two rectal myofascial complexes (RMFCs), allowing apposition under acceptable tension. We used the Kloppel interrupted suture technique, and placed four Smead-Jones internal retention sutures. Our patient made an uneventful recovery, with the wound healing by primary intention.The sample of the peritoneal exudate for culture and sensitivity taken during the initial operation did not grow bacteria. The samples from the three re-operations as well as the urine culture recovered Acinetobacter baumannii (anitratus). Blood samples were sterile. This bacterium is a Gram-negative obligate aerobe that usually causes nosocomial infections that are rarely clinically significant. With sensitivity only to carbapenems, a 6-day course of imipenem (1.5 g/day) led to complete eradication. The exudate samples for biochemical testing for bilirubin and alpha-amylase revealed levels corresponding to non-elevated serum samples.A histological examination of the removed appendix showed that its end was reactively inflamed from the outside in. The mucosa was intact, as was the proximal appendicular wall through its full thickness. This excluded the appendix as the primary source of the infection.Our patient was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. He had normal levels of immunoglobulins and was immunocompetent. Before discharge, the following imaging tests were performed: (a) a follow-through with liquid contrast, which revealed no structural or transit-times abnormalities throughout his gastrointestinal tract, (b) a computed tomography of his abdomen, which showed normal findings for all parenchymal and hollow organs.He was discharged in good health 25 days after admission. He had no complaints at the 1- month and 6-month follow-up. He gained 10 kg in weight and returned to work. His abdominal wall was healthy, an abdominal ultrasound and chest X-ray were normal. A tuberculosis screening test was negative. He continued to be symptom-free with normal findings on physical examination 18 months after discharge.DISCUSSION: The main characteristic aspect of the TP in our case was its slow development. This avoided the need for abdominal paracentesis and determined the clinical presentation. The slow progression of the disease allowed the accumulation and subsequent compression of free gas from anaerobic respiration. In addition, this enabled the mechanical processes of the TP to overlap the immune responses to peritonitis. This gradual increase in IAP provided time for the respiratory and cardiovascular compensatory reserves to intervene. Consequently, the clinical signs were less dramatic compared to cases of TP described in the literature search.Normally, decompression of the abdomen results in rapid hemodynamic stabilization. Although rare, abdominal decompression can cause further hemodynamic deterioration. An immediate drop in IAH can “steal” blood flow, diverting it to the splanchnic area, and reducing heart preload to critical levels. This effect and concomitant decrease in systemic vascular resistance result in a sudden drop in aortic pressure. Reperfusion injury may occur and lead to extreme hyperkalemia and possible cardiac arrest. Therefore, shortly before decompression, the patient should receive an intravenous volume bolus [5]. If hypotension should occur, compression of the aorta at the diaphragmatic hiatus can reduce the vascular bed while the anesthesiologists restore intravascular volume [6].We were unable to isolate the causative agent of the primary peritonitis because the sample was taken using the traditional method for aerobes. The latest guidelines suggest that anaerobic cultures are not necessary for patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infection if empiric antimicrobial therapy active against common anaerobic pathogens is provided [7]. The evidence that the causative agent in our case was an anaerobic bacterium was derived by exclusion of other microorganisms:(a)                      The lack of bacterial growth in an apparent infectious peritonitis without previous antibiotic therapy suggests that an obligate anaerobic bacterium is the sole causative agent. It could not be a facultative anaerobic bacterium or a mixed infection because they would culture on standard agar medium in the presence of oxygen [8].                     (b)                      The odor of rotten eggs is caused by hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This gas is one of the end products of anaerobic respiration and not fermentation. Fungi only use fermentation consequently they could not be the causative agent in this case. This also excludes other aerobes such as fastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, and viruses, none of these produce H2S. Note that certain aerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio organisms can produce H2S, but they would recover on standard agar medium [9].                     (c)                      The rapid improvement in the local findings noticed at the first and second re-laparotomies would only occur if immediate eradication was achieved. This could only take place if an obligate anaerobic bacterium was the sole cause of the infection and then “killed” by the oxygen, antibiotics could not do this within 48 hours [8].The lack of bacterial growth in an apparent infectious peritonitis without previous antibiotic therapy suggests that an obligate anaerobic bacterium is the sole causative agent. It could not be a facultative anaerobic bacterium or a mixed infection because they would culture on standard agar medium in the presence of oxygen [8].The odor of rotten eggs is caused by hydrogen sulfide (H2S).

This could only take place if an obligate anaerobic bacterium was the sole cause of the infection and then “killed” by the oxygen, antibiotics could not do this within 48 hours [8].The clinical features of the case required a laparostomy instead of primary abdominal closure [10]. When a laparostomy is no longer needed but the abdomen would benefit from further debridement, intraperitoneal silo is a viable interim procedure. It was described by Steinberg in 1979 and further developed by Fernandez et al. in 1999 [11]. This technique facilitates early temporary closing of the abdomen with skin sutures, keeping the front abdominal wall free of bowel adhesions for final fascial closure.The latest clinical statements recommend that abdominal fascial closure be made within same-hospital-stay [12]. This was completed on the sixth day after the laparostomy. Despite this early period and the implementation of progressive closure, primary fascial suture was not possible. The clinical statements do not offer clear guidance on the use of CST within the acute settings of closing a laparostomy. Our approach was a “titrated” posterior version of the CST. With this maneuver each RMFC can be advanced medially by 2 to 4 cm [13]. We believe that this approach is safe and efficient in acute settings, provided the gap, which prevents fascial apposition, is ≤6 cm.PBP is extremely rare, comprising less than 1 % of all cases. It is usually monobacterial and develops as a complication of another comorbidity and/or in immunocompromised patients [14]. We searched the same seven electronic libraries and only found three cases of PBP in healthy patients caused by anaerobes: two teenagers and a 21-year-old woman (Additional file 1: Table S2).Although rare, TP is well documented but without classification. Based on the source of gas, we use and present our original classification (Table 1):(a)                      “Primary tension pneumoperitoneum” for those instances in which the cause is localized below the diaphragm, within the peritoneal cavity.                     (b)                      “Secondary tension pneumoperitoneum” for cases in which gas originates above the diaphragm, outside the peritoneal cavity (mediastinum, lungs, and pleural spaces).                     Table 1                      The proposed new classification of tension pneumoperitoneum                    Primary tension pneumoperitoneumSecondary tension pneumoperitoneumFree gas originates below the diaphragm, within the peritoneal cavity.Free gas originates above the diaphragm, outside the peritoneal cavity: mediastinum, lungs, and pleural spaces.Perforation TPNon-perforation TPEsophageal and respiratory perforationsIatrogenic (endoscopy and CPR)Anaerobic gas production (anaerobic bacterial peritonitis)Iatrogenic (EGD, bronchoscopy and orotracheal intubation)Disease Barotrauma (mechanical ventilation and blast injuries)Blunt abdominal trauma and barotrauma (blast injuries)Blunt chest traumaSurgerySurgery                    CPR cardiopulmonary resuscitation, EGD esophagogastroduodenoscopy, TP tension pneumoperitoneum“Primary tension pneumoperitoneum” for those instances in which the cause is localized below the diaphragm, within the peritoneal cavity.“Secondary tension pneumoperitoneum” for cases in which gas originates above the diaphragm, outside the peritoneal cavity (mediastinum, lungs, and pleural spaces).The case here was placed in group (a).CONCLUSION:The combination of TP without perforated hollow viscus and primary anaerobic bacterial peritonitis is an extremely rare scenario in emergency surgery. Our case study provides evidence supporting the infectious etiology of TP. Shortly before laparotomy, the patient should be overhydrated to avoid decompression hypotension. The existing TP in a background of severe abdominal sepsis necessitates laparostomy. The posterior part of the Ramirez operation can be safely utilized, providing the insurmountable gap is ≤6 cm. We classify TP as primary or secondary.;

In addition, central nervous system involvement with dermatomyositis is rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis complicated by leukoencephalopathy in a patient with dermatomyositis accompanied with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old Asian male adolescent with dermatomyositis and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis that were controlled with corticosteroid therapy presented to our hospital with high fever and altered consciousness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cerebral lesions. We diagnosed the central nervous system lesions as leukoencephalopathy secondary to dermatomyositis and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Because corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy was ineffective, he was treated with a modified hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-2004 protocol, which resulted in the disappearance of the lesions of his central nervous system.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-2004 protocol including etoposide should be initiated immediately in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis who respond poorly to treatment for the underlying disease. Moreover, irrespective of the underlying disease, patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with central nervous system lesions might require bone marrow transplantation.;INTRODUCTION: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome associated with a variety of underlying conditions. The hereditary form of HLH is caused by defects in the transport, processing, and function of cytotoxic granules in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and it can manifest in childhood or adulthood. The acquired forms of HLH are caused by infectious diseases, autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and acquired immune deficiency [1]. HLH associated with autoimmune diseases is seen in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still’s disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus, whereas it is rarely seen in patients with dermatomyositis (DM) [2]. HLH is usually treated with intensive immunosuppressive therapy, including immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents. The therapy aims to suppress hypercytokinemia and to eliminate activated and infected cells. The protocol based on HLH-1994/HLH-2004 (with or without cyclosporine A in the first 8 weeks) is currently regarded as the standard of care [3, 4]. Patients with hereditary HLH can be cured only with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, while patients with acquired HLH have shown improved survival when treated with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens [1].DM is an idiopathic acute inflammatory disorder, characterized by inflammation of skeletal muscle, progressive symmetrical proximal myopathy, and classical cutaneous manifestations. The disease is associated with a connective tissue disease or a malignancy [5]. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with DM is rare, and to the best of our knowledge, only five cases have been reported that were associated with juvenile DM, which is a rare, serious autoimmune condition of childhood involving systemic small vessel vasculopathy. It typically affects skin and muscle, but it can also involve the joints, gut, lung, heart, and other internal organs [6].CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old Asian male adolescent was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of sudden-onset fever and altered consciousness. He had a 6-month history of DM complicated by HLH controlled with corticosteroids (60 mg daily) and no obvious family, psychosocial, and genetic history. At the time of diagnosis (6 months prior to admission), heliotrope eruption was seen. A blood examination showed no evidence of myositis-specific antibody (anti-aminoacyl antibody). A muscle biopsy revealed lesions that were consistent with myositis, he met the diagnostic criteria of DM. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination (Fig. 1), bone marrow examination, and liver biopsy had shown no malignancy, therefore, his corticosteroid dose was gradually reduced to 8 mg daily. However, he experienced intermittent leg pain, and laboratory data showed a gradual elevation of creatine kinase (CK) levels and progression of leukopenia over the preceding 6 months, therefore, his steroid therapy was increased to 30 mg daily.                                      Fig. 1                      A positron emission tomography-computed tomography examination at the onset of dermatomyositis and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. No mass lesions was detectedOn the day of admission, he was irritable, but there were no remarkable findings on physical examination. Laboratory data showed increased levels of CK (1869 U/L), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (4120 U/mL), and ferritin (967.4 ng/mL) and decreased counts of white blood cells (3910/μL) and platelets (124,000/μL). C-reactive proteins were hardly detected (0.01 mg/dL). We suspected exacerbation of DM and HLH. Active hemophagocytosis and no malignancy were observed on bone marrow examination. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple bilateral subcortical lesions (Fig. 2). Systemic computed tomography (CT) did not show any evidence of interstitial pneumonia or malignancy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) aspiration revealed the presence of 12 cells (nine neutrophils and 3three lymphocytes), glucose levels of 57 mg/dL, protein levels of 44 mg/dL, adenosine deaminase levels of 3.9 (>1) U/L, and interleukin-6 levels of 91.9 (>4.3) pg/mL. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of his CSF showed no evidence of a recent infection with the Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, human herpes virus 6, and herpes simplex virus. We could not perform a PET-CT examination on admission because of his altered consciousness. On the basis of the MRI findings, elevation of CSF interleukin-6 levels, peripheral blood cell count, and biochemistry results, and the hemophagocytosis observed in the bone marrow, we diagnosed the CNS lesions as leukoencephalopathy secondary to DM and HLH.                                      Fig. 2                      Brain magnetic resonance imaging on the day of admission and on day 261 (showing recurrence). a–c Images on the day of admission, d–f images obtained on day 261 when the patient’s central nervous system symptoms deteriorated. a and d Diffusion-weighted sequences images. b and e Apparent diffusion coefficient images. c and f Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. a, b, d, e show that central nervous system lesions did not derive from vasculitis and cerebrovascular diseases because those were not along the vessels. Hyperintensity in the cortex and subcortical white matter can be seen in c and f. c Margins of the lesion are clearly visualized. f Margins of the lesion are unclearThe clinical course of our patient is presented in Fig. 3. Dexamethasone (DEX) pulse therapy (20 mg daily for 3 days) and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (400 mg/kg/day for 5 days) were initiated on the day of admission to treat his CNS lesions. Methylprednisolone (mPSL, 60 mg daily) was administered post-treatment. His CK levels improved rapidly (from 1869 U/L on the day of admission to 287 U/L on day 14), however, his bicytopenia (leukopenia and thrombopenia) remained unchanged, and his CNS lesions were still observed. Therefore, cyclophosphamide pulse therapy was added on day 8. On day 24, a second bone marrow examination revealed that his hemophagocytosis remained, for which cyclosporine was started the next day. On day 28, the 60 mg daily mPSL was changed to 20 mg daily DEX because DEX diffuses to the CSF more easily than does mPSL. In addition, as his hemophagocytosis persisted, etoposide (120 mg/body) was started on day 38 and was administered once per week between days 38 to 89 (eight times in total). On day 47, tacrolimus was administered instead of cyclosporine to suppress hemophagocytosis because both drugs have the same effects and because of a severe liver function disorder due to cyclosporine (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increased to 318 and 917 IU/mL, respectively). Subsequently, his bicytopenia (leukopenia and thrombopenia) recovered to within normal ranges, and his CNS lesions disappeared.                                      Fig. 3                      Clinical course of the patient. The patient’s central nervous system lesions disappeared completely on day 143 after treatment with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, cyclophosphamide administered intravenously, tacrolimus, and etoposide. However, he experienced a recurrence of the lesions and ultimately died of sepsis on day 348. Laboratory data show that from day 0 to day 80 his white blood cells and platelets decreased and increased. His creatine kinase levels reached a normal range at an early stage, and his soluble interleukin-2 receptor and lactate dehydrogenase levels, biomarkers of malignant lymphoma, were almost normal throughout. In the early stage, we could not distinguish his central nervous system lesions from central nervous system infectious disease owing to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with dermatomyositis, therefore, we administered meropenem and acyclovir. In the first 5 months, we administered sedatives, such as propofol and dexmedetomidine, and antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin and levetiracetam. Ara-c cytarabine, CK creatine kinase, CSF cerebrospinal fluid, DEX dexamethasone, IL-6 interleukin-6, IVCY cyclophosphamide administered intravenously, IVIG intravenous immunoglobulin, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, MA therapy combination therapy with methotrexate and cytarabine, MKC megakaryocyte, mPSL methylprednisolone, MTX methotrexate, NCC nuclear cell count, PLT platelet, PSL prednisolone, sIL-2R soluble interleukin-2 receptor, WBC white blood cellHe was administered sedative drugs to produce a state of calmness, to help him sleep, and to prevent acts of violence caused by his altered state of consciousness that lasted for 5 months. The medications were eventually discontinued because altered consciousness was no longer observed. However, disturbances of his higher cerebral functions remained. Five months after his initial admission, he could speak and walk like a very young child. Corticosteroid therapy was successfully tapered without a relapse of his symptoms (including fever and altered consciousness), and without changes in his laboratory and MRI findings.Eight months after admission, a follow-up brain MRI revealed a recurrence of the CNS lesions (Fig. 2), although these recurrent lesions were different from the previous lesions, considering that there was no fever and no altered consciousness. Moreover, his laboratory findings were normal. We hypothesized that the pathology of the new CNS lesions differed from the pathology of the previous lesions and presumed that they were caused by progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or drug-induced (tacrolimus) leukoencephalopathy. However, a PCR analysis for the John Cunningham virus in his CSF (to diagnose progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) was negative, and no improvement in CNS lesions was observed when tacrolimus was discontinued.One month after the recurrence of the CNS lesions, his abilities to walk and speak deteriorated. A MRI revealed a progression of the CNS lesions, therefore, a brain biopsy of his right frontal lobe was performed on day 297. On day 325, a diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) was made based on the T-cell receptor rearrangement seen in the tumor cells of his brain specimen. Therefore, on day 330, chemotherapy combined with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine was initiated. A follow-up MRI on day 345 revealed that his CNS lesions had increased in size, suggesting that the chemotherapy regimen was ineffective, and he died of sepsis on day 348.An autopsy revealed yellowish to brownish extended geographic lesions with softening, atrophy, and cavitation in the white matter of the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Hepatomegaly (1910 g) and splenomegaly (205 g) were also observed. Microscopy of the cerebral white matter showed bilateral extended multiple liquefaction necroses (Fig. 4a). Infiltration of predominantly CD8(+) T cells undergoing dyskaryosis or mitosis was observed in the Virchow–Robin space (Fig. 4b, c), bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The rearrangements of the TCR gene were confirmed by PCR of a brain specimen. Hemophagocytosis was observed in the spleen and bone marrow. On immunohistochemistry, no cells were positive for herpes simplex virus or John Cunningham virus, and Epstein–Barr virus-encoded ribonucleic acid in situ hybridization was negative.

Magnification ×40. b Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrations is seen. Magnification ×100. c Some mitotic changes are observed (arrow). Magnification ×400DISCUSSION: The patient presented here had a combination of several very rare diseases (DM, HLH, and CNS lesions). His condition was refractory, but it could be improved through intensive chemotherapy including etoposide (the modified HLH-2004 protocol).Typically, most CNS lesions that appear acutely during immunosuppressive therapy are caused by infection. However, in this case, no infectious diseases were identified. Next, we suspected that the CNS lesions were caused by DM, however, his brain MRI findings revealed no evidence of vasculopathy or vasculitis, which are often seen in CNS lesions due to juvenile DM [7, 8]. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus was also excluded through blood and CSF examinations. Finally, we considered that the patterns of the CNS lesions on MRI closely resembled CNS lesions in patients with hereditary HLH who exhibit diffuse leptomeningeal and perivascular enhancement (corresponding to meningeal and perivascular infiltrations of histiocytes and lymphocytes), patchy areas of increased T2 signal intensity in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, and a diffuse parenchymal volume loss of the cerebrum and cerebellum [9]. Henter and Elinder described cases of progressive encephalopathy (termed CNS-HLH in their report) that were diagnosed on brain necropsy. The pathophysiology of CNS-HLH has been characterized as a perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes in the cerebral parenchyma [10].CNS involvement is commonly seen in patients with hereditary HLH [11]. However, CNS involvement is less commonly seen in patients with autoimmune-associated HLH than in patients with malignancy-associated and viral infection-associated HLH. Gupta et al. reported that HLH was associated with rheumatic disease, malignancy, and viral/other complications by CNS disease in 14 %, 38 %, and 31 % of cases, respectively [12]. In our patient, natural killer cell activity was normal, and protein levels of Munc13-4, Munc18-2, syntaxin 11, and integrin αIIβ were normal, mutations in the genes coding for these proteins are associated with the onset of hereditary HLH [1]. Kim et al. reported that CNS involvement was associated with poor outcomes in patients with HLH and emphasized that the timely administration of chemotherapy (especially the early use of cyclosporine) was important for improving survival [13].Yamashita et al. reported a case of HLH associated with DM complicated by CNS lesions, this case was identified on a postmortem examination [14]. Similar to our case, induction therapy, a combination of DEX pulse therapy and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy, and cyclosporine therapy was used in their patient. However, in contrast to Yamashita et al. [14] who used corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide, we used etoposide in accordance with the modified HLH-2004 protocol. We believe that the CNS lesions caused by HLH in our case improved owing to the early treatment based on the HLH-2004 protocol.Haddad et al. have described the poor outcomes of CNS disease in patients with HLH. According to the results of their study, bone marrow transplantation (BMT) appears to be the only available treatment procedure capable of preventing HLH CNS disease progression and that can cure the patient when performed early after remission [11]. BMT was not performed after the recurrence of the CNS lesions in our case. In hindsight, considering the results, we should have performed BMT after the CNS lesions disappeared. The reason that we did not perform BMT was that there was no evidence for the effectiveness of BMT for HLH associated with autoimmune diseases complicated by CNS lesions, and those lesions had completely disappeared on MRI. Patients with DM are often known to have malignancies [5]. In our case, no malignancies were found on the PET-CT examination at the time of diagnosis of DM and HLH. We could not confirm the coexistence of PTCL on the day of admission because PET-CT examination and brain biopsy were not performed. Nevertheless, considering that the CNS lesions disappeared after the initial therapy and that PTCL cannot be controlled by immunochemotherapy according to the HLH-2004 protocol, we speculate that the initial CNS lesions were not from PTCL. If the CNS lesions had been derived from PTCL, it is unlikely that the CNS lesions would have disappeared with treatment following the HLH-2004 protocol. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the literature that PTCL complicated by CNS lesions could be cured by treatment following the HLH-2004 protocol. Therefore, we hypothesize that our patient experienced T-cell lymphoma either as an adverse effect of immunosuppressant therapy or due to chronic inflammation during his clinical course.CONCLUSION:Our findings show that it is necessary to immediately administer additional intensive immunosuppressive therapies, such as those indicated in the HLH-2004protocol, including etoposide, to patients with corticosteroid-resistant acquired HLH due to autoimmune disease. In addition, a biopsy should be performed as early as possible for brain lesions of unknown origin. Patients with HLH with CNS lesions might require BMT to achieve good clinical outcomes.;

FLNA mutations were recently found to be associated with lung disease. In this study, we report a novel FLNA gene associated with significant lung disease and unique angiogenesis.CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a 1-year-old Saudi female child with respiratory distress at birth. The child then had recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, bilateral lung emphysema with basal atelectasis, bronchospasm, pulmonary artery hypertension, and oxygen and mechanical ventilation dependency. Molecular testing showed a new pathogenic variant of one copy of c.3153dupC in exon 21 in the FLNA gene.CONCLUSION: Our data support previous reports in the literature that associate FLNA gene mutation and lung disease.;INTRODUCTION: Filamin A is a 280-kD protein that crosslinks actin filaments into orthogonal networks in cortical cytoplasm and participates in the anchoring of membrane proteins for the actin cytoskeleton. Remodeling of the cytoskeleton is central to the modulation of cell shape and migration. Filamin A, encoded by the FLNA gene, is a widely expressed protein that regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with integrins, transmembrane receptor complexes, and second messengers, thus mutations in the gene encoding filamin A (FLNA) lead to diseases with high phenotypic diversity including the following: periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), skeletal dysplasia, otopalatodigital spectrum disorders such as Melnick-Needles syndrome and frontometaphyseal dysplasia [1–5], cardiovascular abnormalities that include patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), valvular disease, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-like phenotype [6–8], and coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia [9]. Recently, Masurel-Paulet et al. [1], de Wit and colleagues [10], and Lord et al. [11] reported associations between pulmonary diseases in both sexes with substantial heterogeneity in manifestations and lethality. Here, we report the case of a female child with a novel FLNA gene mutation who developed significant lung disease and unique angiogenesis.CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient is a 1-year-old Saudi female child who was referred from another hospital after PDA ligation, left inguinal hernia repair, accidental fracture of her right ulna and radius, and prolonged mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient was sent to our hospital for further evaluation due to ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Our patient was the third child of nonconsanguineous Saudi parents and was born via cesarean section at 36 weeks gestation due to fetal distress. The child was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for 5 days because of respiratory distress and was ventilated for 36 hours. The mother has epilepsy and the father has been diagnosed with Behcet's disease. Since the age of 2 months, the child had multiple lengthy admissions in different hospitals (for 1 to 3 months at a time) for recurrent cyanotic events, respiratory distress, frequent choking with feeding, and significant vomiting. The child had accumulated the following diagnoses: severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), failure to thrive requiring prolonged nasogastric tube feeding, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, anoxic convulsions, chronic lung disease with prolonged oxygen dependency, reversible bronchospasm, left external iliac vein thrombosis, and developmental delay. She had two prior prolonged stays at our institution.The first admission was due to rhinovirus infection and clinically diagnosed recurrent aspiration secondary to aberrant right subclavian artery (dysphagia lusoria) with prolonged oxygen therapy. The second admission was for respiratory failure that required prolonged intubation including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation complicated by recurrent lung atelectasis and right lung pneumothorax. She failed multiple trials of extubation and unfortunately died of cardiac arrest due to sepsis while receiving maximal supportive therapy. An initial physical examination during the first admission revealed a baby girl in poor health with the following clinical values: moderate respiratory distress and a respiratory rate of 70/min, heart rate of 144/min, blood pressure of 101/47 with saturation of 95% on 1.5 L/min, body weight of 5.9 kg (below the third percentile), and height of 69 cm (at the tenth percentile).The child had diminished breath sounds bilaterally with a prolonged expiratory phase, wheezing, and scattered crackles posteriorly, mild hypotonia, and significant hyperlaxity. Investigations showed normal sweat chloride level, and immune function testing was normal. A chest X-ray (Fig. 1) showed multiple subsegmental atelectasis and areas of air trapping. Computed tomography and angiography of her chest (Fig. 2) revealed bilateral lower lobe airspace disease, hyperinflation of the right middle lobe and left upper lobe including the lingual, and an enlarged main pulmonary artery. The sagittal view (Fig. 3) showed a right aberrant subclavian artery causing posterior compression to the esophagus at the level of the T4 vertebra and minimal compression in the posterior trachea. An echocardiogram showed no residual PDA or significant evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Barium administration (Fig. 4) showed external compression along the posterior wall of the proximal third of the esophagus, which was causing significant narrowing of the esophageal lumen. The pH probe showed no significant GERD. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed there was a narrowed and compressed area located 18 cm into the esophagus at T4, and was identified with marked pulsation. The flexible bronchoscopy showed complete ring and narrowing of the lower third of the trachea. A lung biopsy (Fig. 5) showed alveolated lung parenchyma with alveolar simplification, in which alveoli do not show age-appropriate normal architecture, compared with the normal alveolar architecture (Fig. 6). There was no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain because our patient's condition did not allow it.

This variant has not been reported in individuals with FLNA-related disorders but is expected to cause disease.CONCLUSION:In this case report, we describe another confirmatory mutation in the gene encoding filamin A (FLNA) in a female child with lung disease. Our patient was a female child who was confirmed to have a pathogenic variant of the FLNA gene c.3153dupC. This mutation has not been reported in individuals with FLNA-related disorders but is expected to cause disease. Similar to other reported cases, our child also manifested clinical symptoms at an early age [10, 11]. She had respiratory distress at birth and then had recurrent lower respiratory tract infections/bronchiolitis, bilateral lung emphysema with basal atelectasis, bronchospasm, pulmonary artery hypertension, and long oxygen and mechanical ventilatory dependency after 2 months of age. A lung biopsy showed alveolated lung parenchyma with alveolar simplification similar to the finding by Lord et al. [11]. This child also manifested associated clinical features reported with other filamin gene mutations including patent ductus arteriosis (PDA), hypotonia, joint laxity, and developmental delay [10]. These clinical and histological features are similar to cases reported with the pulmonary phenotype of FLNA (Table 1). However, an unusual clinical manifestation in our case is severe reflux that caused recurrent aspiration symptoms and dysphagia lusoria (secondary to aberrant right subclavian artery that caused significant esophageal compression). This abnormal angiogenesis has been reported only in FLNA-null mice, which have vascular endothelial cells that show defective cell–cell contacts and adherens junctions. The result is abnormal angiogenesis with disorganized blood vessels and aberrant branching [7, 12]. There are other possible pulmonary phenotypes of FLNA gene mutation suggested due to its role in T cell activation, interleukin production [13], inflammatory signaling [14], and interaction with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [15]. There has been no specific sensitivity to infections observed in FLNA patients [10]. However, our patient was noted to have severe prolonged courses of viral or bacterial infections. The pathogenic variant of FLNA gene mutation in our reported case is not confirmed to have association with periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNH), and our patient was too ill to complete brain MRI. The patient’s mother has epilepsy beginning in the third decade of life.

Our patient had acute pancreatitis superimposed on chronic calcific pancreatitis and chronic renal impairment. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was used to assess post-embolization results.CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 67-year-old white Caucasian man with recurrent pancreatitis. Computed tomography angiography showed a pancreatic pseudocyst with a ruptured pseudoaneurysm, which was successfully embolized using an endovascular percutaneous approach. At six months, persistent renal failure led to contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. This confirmed the absence of turbulent blood flow and extravasation of contrast medium in the pseudocyst.CONCLUSION: Our experience with this case leads us to support the role of interventional radiology as a first-line treatment tool. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography can be used to follow-up embolization procedures in patients with impaired renal function.;INTRODUCTION: Severe pancreatic inflammation and necrosis, which cause the local spread of pancreatic fluids rich in exocrine enzymes, may cause elastolytic erosions of the vessel wall, representing one of the causes of vessel injury [1–4]. This can lead to vascular complications, such as the formation of a pseudoaneurysm if there is bleeding into a contained space or organ, a contained hematoma if the pseudoaneurysm becomes thrombosed or active extravasation stops, or frank intraperitoneal hemorrhage if the pseudoaneurysm ruptures. Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm (PSA) is a rare vascular complication of pancreatitis, with an incidence up to 10% in patients with chronic disease. It commonly results from the erosion of the pancreatic or peripancreatic arteries into a pseudocyst, creating a permanent communication between the vasculature and the pseudocyst itself [1].In the setting of chronic pancreatitis causing pseudoaneurysm, the most commonly involved artery is the splenic artery (60% to 65%), followed by gastroduodenal (20% to 25%), pancreaticoduodenal (10% to 15%), hepatic (5% to 10%) and left gastric arteries (2% to 5%). Less frequently involved are the dorsal pancreatic, hepatic and superior mesenteric arteries [2]. These vascular complications may have an unpredictable evolution and can have lethal consequences caused by rupture and massive bleeding. Mortality can be 12.5% in treated patients and higher than 90% in untreated patients [3, 5]. Historically, pseudoaneurysms secondary to pancreatitis were treated surgically, with an associated mortality of approximately 56%. Thanks to the advances in interventional radiological techniques, the paradigm has largely shifted towards endovascular treatment.We report the successful endovascular treatment of a PSA in a patient with acute pancreatitis superimposed on chronic calcific pancreatitis and renal impairment. Our experience with this case leads us to support the first-line role of urgent endovascular ligature confirmed by the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in patients with impaired renal function [6]. The report has been approved by our Internal Review Board and our patient has given his consent.CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old white Caucasian man with chronic pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and impaired renal function presented to our emergency department for anorexia and moderate to intense pain in his epigastrium radiating to his back. His usual analgesics had not lessened the pain, which had worsened in the previous four days. On physical examination he was cachectic, pale, oriented and apyretic (36.8°C). He had normal heart sounds (78 beats per minute) and a slightly high arterial pressure (147/80mmHg). His abdomen was particularly tender in the left upper epigastric area and the tenderness increased with palpation. Laboratory tests revealed the following data: leukocytosis at 11×10−3/μL, low hemoglobin level of 8.1g/dL, platelet count of 258×10−3/μL, serum creatinine of 2.35mg/dL, lipase level of 420IU/L, amylase of 220IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase of 450IU/L, glucose of 76mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 45IU/L and total bilirubin of 1.1mg/dL. He had no history of previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding.We performed contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), which showed a normally enhancing pancreas, with enhancement comparable to that of his spleen even though the head and body of the pancreas were slightly enlarged with subtle peripheral fat-stranding. Prior to contrast medium (CM) administration, subtle calcifications had been visible throughout the pancreas body. These findings were suggestive of edematous, interstitial pancreatitis superimposed on chronic calcific pancreatitis. A 5.1cm pseudocyst was visible in the pancreatic tail, characterized by hyper-dense content in the non-enhanced contrast scan (mean density 54 Hounsfield units, standard deviation 13.8), that did not enhance after CM administration. We first suspected proteinaceous content, but then detected enlarged, twisty, dilated vessels within the cyst, arising from a branch of the patient’s splenic artery. This was highly suspicious for the presence of a bleeding pancreatic PSA. On the basis of the density values of the pseudocyst without and after intravenous CM administration (Figure 1a-d), we could not exclude a recent bleed.                                      Figure 1                      Initial radiology findings. (a) Non-enhanced computed tomography showing a thin, dense imbibition of fat around the pancreatic tail (asterisk) near a 5.1cm pseudocyst with hyper-dense content and a gallstone inside the gallbladder (arrow). (b-d) Contrast-enhanced computed tomography shows a pseudoaneurysm arising from a splenic artery branch inside the pseudocyst.The possibility of surgical hemostasis was discarded by surgeons because of his multiple severe systemic illnesses and very poor general performance. He had severe pulmonary hypertension due to an advanced idiopathic interstitial fibrosis, and severe impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)a = 28mL/min/1.73m2. Because of his low hemoglobin level, an emergency celiac angiography was planned after collegial discussion with surgeons to exclude an active bleeding arising from the PSA. A splenic angiogram showed an active extravasation of CM originating from the PSA, which showed well after a super-selective catheterization obtained with a 2.7-F coaxial micro-catheter (Progreat, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Therefore, an endovascular ligature was tried as first-line therapy. Considering the tortuosity of his splenic artery, the micro-catheter was placed into his splenic artery distal to the pseudoaneurysm to achieve distal embolization with three (two 5mm and one 6mm) metallic microcoils (VortX, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). After micro-catheter retraction proximal to the pseudoaneurysm, two (one 5mm and one 6mm) metallic microcoils (VortX) were deployed (Figure 2a-d). Angiography after endovascular ligature showed exclusion of the PSA with stagnation of CM within the pseudocyst (Figure 2a-d).Our patient’s clinical course was acceptable with progressive hemoglobin recovery up to 11.4g/dL 48h after the transarterial embolization. Wide-spectrum antibiotics and analgesic and antipyretic drugs were administrated to prevent infectious complications and to control pain. Six days after the procedure, CECT confirmed the complete exclusion of the splenic pseudoaneurysm with the same ‘stagnation’ of CM (Figure 3a-c) that was appreciable on the post-embolization angiogram. Some ischemic damage of the spleen was identified, but most of the splenic parenchymal vascularization was present.

(d) Final angiogram showed the presence of distal and proximal metallic microcoils after their deployment.

Computed tomography performed (a) without intravenous contrast medium administration and (b,c) after administration shows microcoils deployed in the splenic artery, with stagnation of contrast medium inside the pseudocyst (asterisks in a) and exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm in the arterial (b) and venous (c) phase.Our patient was discharged in a stable condition. Follow-up at three and six months comprised combined color Doppler ultrasound with CEUS using a dedicated CM (Sonovue, Bracco, Italy) (Figure 4a-c) because of the persistent elevation of his serum creatinine levels (1.7mg/dL and eGFR with MDRD = 40mL/min/1.73m2). This choice was concordant with European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines [6] to consider an imaging method that does not use iodine-based CM in order to reduce the risk of a CM-induced nephropathy (CIN) in a patient at high risk (eGFR lower than 45mL/min/1.73m2). Both examinations confirmed the presence of a pancreatic pseudocyst with a slightly increased diameter (60mm) without signs of active bleeding inside the cyst (Figure 4a-c).                                      Figure 4                      Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography performed after six months. (a-c) Shows the presence of deployed metallic microcoils (arrowheads, a-c) and the absence of reperfusion of the pseudocyst after intravenous contrast medium administration.DISCUSSION: Hemorrhage is a rare but potentially fatal complication in pancreatitis, with a greater incidence observed in chronic disease (7% to 10%) than in acute (1% to 6%) [2]. Pseudoaneurysms may cause bleeding if they rupture into the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum or adjacent structures, such as bowel (presenting as massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage) or pancreatic duct of Wirsung (presenting as hemosuccus pancreaticus) [4]. In the detection of vascular injuries due to pancreatitis, CECT and, less frequently, ultrasonography (US) represent non-invasive and suitable first-line imaging modalities. In our case, CECT detected the presence of a PSA, while angiography revealed its bleeding and permitted its embolization. One significant advantage of angiography is in the evaluation of the arterial bed in real-time, allowing an assessment of the vascular supply and collateral circulation. This information is required to plan treatment. Moreover, angiography may identify other smaller pseudoaneurysms not seen by US or CECT. It can also help discriminate PSA from other lesions, such as true aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas and vascular malformations, which can have similar appearances on other imaging modalities. Because of its high sensitivity (100%) in the detection of arterial bleeding, angiography remains the diagnostic gold standard when endovascular treatment is indicated [2–6].The natural course of PSA is unpredictable, and so treatment is recommended [5]. In the management of PSAs several factors have to be considered, including hemodynamic stability, coagulation status and source of bleeding. Traditionally, surgery was the treatment of choice, including arterial ligation, direct intra-pseudocystic ligation, and resection of a part of the pancreas. The morbidity of surgical interventions has been reported between 16% and 50% [2]. With the advancement of endovascular techniques, endovascular ligature has become the first-line treatment [2]. In some cases, transarterial catheter embolization can be performed before surgery to stop bleeding, as surgery sometimes is not indicated in emergent conditions in patients with hemodynamic instability and hemorrhagic shock [5]. However, endovascular therapy remains the first-line option for known arterial bleeding (preferably in a patient with a stable hemodynamic status) and is considered a safe and effective modality to treat visceral pseudoaneurysms [4, 7]. Metallic coil embolization is preferable distal and proximal to the site of arterial extravasation (the so-called sandwich technique, or endovascular ligature), thereby preventing backflow from the collateral circulation [4, 7, 8]. According to data in the literature, endovascular ligature was the fastest way to arrest bleeding in our patient and may be considered a life-saving procedure. We controlled ischemic damage of the spleen allowing the revascularization of the splenic parenchyma by collateral branches. Any infectious complications were prevented with antibiotic prophylaxis.An important aspect emerging in the follow-up of a ligated PSA in a patient with impaired renal function is the choice of CEUS. According to ESUR guidelines [6], in the planning of elective examinations, it is mandatory to select an imaging method that does not use iodine-based contrast in a patient at high risk for a CIN. Adverse events (such as nephropathy) for sonographic contrast agents have not been reported in the literature [6, 9–11]. Our experience with this case underlines the rare possibility of a vascular complication in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. When clinical data and laboratory tests are suggestive for a vascular complication, an urgent diagnosis is necessary. An early diagnosis may be life-saving for the patient. An endovascular approach is now usually the first choice of treatment, another aspect to bear in mind is the importance of an endovascular ligature of the PSA to account for the presence of multiple collateral branches that may refill the PSA. Moreover, the role of CEUS during follow-up in asymptomatic and stable patients should be emphasized.CONCLUSION:Our case represents an example of successful management of a rare vascular complication in a patient with chronic pancreatitis and several important comorbidities. Our experience supports the first-line role of interventional radiology, and demonstrated a successful outcome of an endovascular ligature without the need for surgery. We encourage the use of CEUS to follow-up embolization procedures in patients with impaired renal function.;

The case points out that an intraabdominal origin should be considered in patients presenting with rapidly spreading soft tissue infections of the trunk.CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old European woman presented to our hospital with a 1-week history of severe abdominal pain accompanied by rapidly spreading erythema and emphysema of the lower abdomen. On admission, the patient was in septic shock with leukocytosis and elevation of C-reactive protein. Among other diagnoses, necrotizing fasciitis was suspected. Computed tomography showed a large soft tissue infection with air-fluid levels spreading through the lower abdominal wall. During the operation, we found a perforated appendicitis breaking through the fascia and causing a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection of the abdominal wall. Appendicitis was the origin of the soft tissue infection. The abdominal wall was only secondarily involved.CONCLUSION: Even though perforated appendicitis as an etiology of a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection of the abdominal wall is very rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal wall cellulitis. The distinction between rapidly spreading subcutaneous infection with abscess formation and early onset of necrotizing fasciitis is often difficult and can be confirmed only by surgical intervention.;INTRODUCTION: Soft tissue infections are very common in adult patients. Usually, they present with redness, swelling, and pain [1]. The clinical distinction between simple cellulitis and a rapidly spreading soft tissue infection, sometimes caused by gas-forming organisms and evolving into a life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis, is often difficult [2]. Laboratory tests may not differentiate the two diagnoses, but performing imaging using computed tomography (CT) or using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with extensive stranding of the subcutaneous tissue, gas, and the rapidly developing clinical picture of systemic inflammatory response may help to obtain the correct diagnosis [1, 3].Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical diseases and is usually managed by appendectomy with low morbidity and mortality. Complications such as perforation with abscess formation and localized or four-quadrant peritonitis occur in about 15% of patients [4, 5]. However, the perforation of an appendicular abscess through the abdominal wall and an ensuing soft tissue infection are rare events nowadays.This case report describes a rare complication of an appendicular abscess perforating into the abdominal wall and its surgical management. The case demonstrates that an intraabdominal origin has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue infection of the abdominal wall.CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old European woman with a medical history of hypertension, asthma, and depression presented to our emergency department with abdominal pain of 1 week’s duration. Over the preceding 3 days, the patient’s condition had declined rapidly with general weakness and severe escalating but rather superficial abdominal pain.On admission, the patient complained of abdominal pain. Her temperature was 35.1°C, blood pressure was 63/46 mmHg, and heart rate was 88 beats/minute. She was not oriented to time and space. Her physical examination revealed truncal obesity (36.3 kg/m2) with an irregular patch of erythema and tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and crepitation on palpation. The skin in the area of the erythema was hypoesthesic.Initial laboratory test results showed a C-reactive protein of 439 mg/L as well as a white blood cell count of 50 g/L with 48% neutrophils. Her serum creatinine was 239 μmol/L, sodium was 131 mmol/L, and potassium was 3.3 mmol/L. An immediate abdominal CT was performed. No venous contrast was used, owing to the patient’s increased creatinine and oliguria. CT showed extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right and left lower quadrants with small pockets of air-fluid levels (Fig. 1). There was no intraabdominal free fluid, free air, or any sign of intraabdominal inflammation. However, a contiguity of the cecum to the abdominal wall and to the subcutaneous collection was noted.                                      Fig. 1                      Computed tomography performed on the patient’s admission shows extensive emphysema in the subcutaneous tissue without any signs of an intraabdominal infectionThe differential diagnosis included necrotizing fasciitis, a tumor of the appendix or the cecum with perforation into the abdominal wall, or acute perforated appendicitis. After stabilization of the patient’s septic shock with 3 L of normal saline, she was urgently taken to the operating theater. First, diagnostic laparoscopy using a midline supraumbilical open approach was performed to evaluate for a potentially intraabdominal origin of the abdominal wall infection. It revealed an ileocecal area adherent to the abdominal wall without any signs of intraabdominal infection (Fig. 2). However, after lateral mobilization of the cecum, an abscess cavity with perforation into the abdominal wall was found (Fig. 3). After horizontal incision and debridement of the subcutaneous tissue were performed, the defect in the muscular layers of the abdominal wall measured 7 × 7 cm (Fig. 4). Perforated appendicitis appeared to be the source of the infectious process. The stump of the appendix was closed by a suture ligation. At that point, an ileocolic resection with a diverted ileostomy was not considered necessary, owing to the lack of intraabdominal infection and the fact that it would have been complicated by the extensive defect and inflammation of the abdominal wall as well as by the obesity of the patient. The defect of the abdominal wall was covered using an omental patch. A dressing with Betadine (Purdue Products, Stamford, CT, USA)-soaked gauze was applied to the debrided wound from the outside.                                      Fig. 2                      Diagnostic laparoscopy without any signs of intraabdominal infection and ileocecal area adherent to the abdominal wall                                                          Fig. 3                      Stool in the subcutaneous tissue from the perforated appendix                                                          Fig. 4                      Situs after radical debridement of the subcutaneous tissue. However, the fascia is not involved. The arrow marks the site of the perforation through the abdominal wall                                                           Fig. 5                      TimelinePostoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit in continuing septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction, including acute kidney and liver failure as well as septic encephalopathy. She remained on mechanical ventilation for 5 days. Bacteriological results from blood cultures as well as abscess and peritoneal fluids were positive for Escherichia coli. Intravenous antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g three times daily was started immediately after surgery and continued for 20 days. After 24 h, a second surgical look of the abdominal wall was performed in the operating theater with additional debridement of necrotic subcutaneous tissue. Afterward, the wound was dressed with a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device (V.A.C.® GranuFoamTM, Acelity, San Antonio, TX, USA) according to standard procedure in our clinic. On the sixth postoperative day (POD), the patient was taken to the operating theater for a change of the VAC dressing. Unfortunately, we discovered a leakage of feces through the abdominal defect caused by an insufficiency of the appendicular stump. This led us to decide to perform a cecal wedge resection because the cecum showed good blood circulation and no signs of infection. According to our opinion, an ileostomy was not necessary in this situation. Performing an ileostomy clearly would have been very demanding in this severely obese patient with a huge defect of the abdominal wall.Because of the highly contaminated wound, we used a biological mesh (STRATTICE™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix, LifeCell/Acelity, Branchburg, NJ, USA) to cover the defect with no further reconstruction of the abdominal wall. The cutaneous and subcutaneous defect was closed by an axial transposition flap (skin and subcutaneous tissue) from the right upper abdomen on POD 14.Three days later, the wound had to be partially reopened because of necrosis of the transposition flap. Again, a wound dressing with a VAC device was applied. The dressing was changed regularly, first with the patient under general anesthesia in the operating theater, later at bedside.The patient was transferred to the surgical ward on POD 10 and discharged on POD 42 to a rehabilitation unit in improved general condition (Fig. 5)﻿. The further changes of the VAC dressing were performed on an outpatient basis. Three months after primary admission, the skin defect was closed by mesh skin graft.Six months after the closure of the abdominal wall defect with a biological mesh, the patient developed an incisional hernia. A retromuscular hernia repair was performed with a mesh that is manufactured from approximately equal parts of absorbable poliglecaprone 25 monofilament fiber and nonabsorbable polypropylene monofilament fiber (ULTRAPRO, Ethicon/Johnson & Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA) because it is the standard mesh for incisional hernias in our hospital. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and she fully recovered.DISCUSSION: Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain and can affect all age groups. Perforation is seen in 20–30% of these patients. Once perforation has occurred, complications such as wound infection, abscess formation, and peritonitis are frequent [6, 7]. An abscess of the abdominal wall due to perforated appendicitis represents a rare but dangerous complication with increased mortality [8]. Early open or laparoscopic removal of the inflamed appendix is the most effective method of preventing complications [4, 6, 8]. In retrospect, performing an ileocolic resection with diverting ileostomy instead of only removal of the inflamed appendix would have spared our patient the complication of an appendicular stump insufficiency.To the best of our knowledge, only two similar cases with gas-forming abscesses of the abdominal wall due to perforated appendicitis have been published [8, 9]. Authors of other publications reported cases of acute appendicitis complicated by necrotizing fasciitis of the abdominal wall or of the lower limb, including one case of Fournier’s gangrene [8].The distinction between rapidly spreading soft tissue infection and the early onset of necrotizing fasciitis remains challenging. While rapid and extensive surgical treatment of fasciitis can be lifesaving, soft tissue infection without abscess formation requires primarily antibiotic treatment [2].Soft tissue infections are very common in primary care [1]. They generally involve skin and subcutaneous tissue and most commonly occur in the lower extremities [1]. Patients present with pain, redness, and swelling of the involved skin. Fever and general symptoms are most frequently mild [1].In contrast, necrotizing soft tissue infections may spread rapidly and develop along fascial planes, occasionally sparing skin and underlying muscle [1, 3, 10]. These patients experience pain, fever, rapid deterioration, gas or crepitus, and a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with elevated inflammatory markers [1, 11, 12].Our patient showed rapidly progressing erythema with severe pain, hemodynamic instability, oliguria, crepitation, and septic shock syndrome, which were highly suspicious for necrotizing fasciitis. A Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score developed to differentiate between soft tissue infection and necrotizing fasciitis was 8 points, representing a risk of over 90% for necrotizing fasciitis. This score includes routine laboratory values, such as C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, sodium, creatinine, glucose, and hemoglobin levels [2, 10].The use of CT is helpful to confirm the diagnosis of a soft tissue infection, especially when air associated with fluid collection is found. Additionally, it can provide information about involvement of intraabdominal organs as a source for the infection [13–15]. MRI has been shown to be the most precise imaging method to differentiate between a simple subcutaneous infection and necrotizing fasciitis [1, 3]. However, MRI examination is time-consuming and not always available. Nevertheless, as shown in our patient’s case, final confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis can be achieved only during surgical exploration with histological and microbiological workup [1, 3].CONCLUSION:Even though perforated appendicitis as an etiology of a spreading subcutaneous infection of the abdominal wall is a rare entity, intraabdominal causes (e.g., appendicitis, diverticulitis) ought to be considered when faced with a patient with abdominal wall cellulitis, and cross-sectional abdominal imaging should be performed prior to surgical debridement.;

It mainly affects – by order of decreasing frequency – the bone, the skin, the lymph nodes, the liver, and lungs. Gastrointestinal tract involvement is extremely rare in adults.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 32-year-old Middle Eastern man with Langerhans cell histiocytosis involving his lungs and the colorectoanal part of his gastrointestinal tract, with complete resolution of gastrointestinal tract lesions following a non-standardized chemotherapy regimen.CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal tract lesions are a rare manifestation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, especially when associated with extraintestinal involvement, such as the lungs. Chemotherapy protocols have not been well established for the treatment of the disease. The clinical impact of the effective chemotherapy regimen used to treat this uncommon presentation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis will be viewed in this case report.;INTRODUCTION: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) or histiocytosis X is a rare systemic disease characterized by the abnormal overproduction of histiocytes that tend to infiltrate tissues and organ systems leading to organ damage. Its estimated incidence in adults is approximately one to two cases per million persons [1] compared to three to five cases per million in the pediatric population. The pathogenesis of LCH is still under debate. It is unknown whether LCH is a reactive or neoplastic process. LCH is of reactive nature when remissions occur spontaneously [2]. On the other hand, the infiltration of organs by a monoclonal population of aberrant cells, the possibility of lethal evolution, and the cancer-based modalities of successful treatment are all consistent with a neoplastic process [2, 3]. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement is extremely rare in adults.In this case report, we highlight an unusual presentation of LCH and the effectiveness of a non-standardized chemotherapy protocol for the treatment of this rare disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe pulmonary and GI tract involvement. Here we present the case of a 32-year-old man with LCH involving the lungs and the colorectoanal part of the GI tract, with complete resolution of GI tract lesions following chemotherapy.CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old Middle Eastern man, who smoked 20 cigarettes per day and was an occasional alcohol consumer, with a family history of thyroid disease, presented to our emergency room with multiple painful anal lesions that started to appear a few weeks prior to presentation with occasional bleeding and purulent discharge. His past medical history was significant for diabetes insipidus 10 years ago after recurrent complaints of polyuria and polydipsia. At 26 years of age, he started complaining of non-productive cough and exertional dyspnea. A chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest done at another institution showed the presence of bilateral pulmonary cystic lesions involving the upper lobes. He was misdiagnosed to have pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was started on high-dose orally administered prednisone therapy 2 years later, then received daily budesonide/formoterol without clinical improvement. Four years later, a high resolution multi-detector CT scan of his chest showed massive honeycombing cystic changes of both lung fields with intermingled fibrosis in between. Findings were suggestive of histiocytosis X. A transbronchial biopsy of the lung lesions confirmed the diagnosis of adult pulmonary LCH (Fig. 1).

He was conscious and oriented. His vital signs were within normal limits except for tachycardia of 112 beats per minute. There were no palpable cervical or inguinal lymph nodes. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a rapid heart rate with regular S1 and S2 without murmur. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral scattered wheezes best heard at the upper lung fields. His abdomen was soft and non-tender. Macroscopic examination of his anal canal revealed a cutaneous lesion infiltrating the anal sphincter with circumferential perianal lesions and eroded ulcerative plaques over the anal orifice (Fig. 2).                                      Fig. 2                      Perianal skin lesions due to Langerhans cell histiocytosisHe was admitted for further evaluation and management. A laboratory workup revealed a normal white cell count 7200/μL (normal range 4000 to 11,000/μL) with 76% neutrophils, normal levels of hemoglobin 16.1 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.75 mg/dL. His C-reactive protein was 26 mg/L (normal < 10 mg/L). Liver function tests and electrolytes were all normal. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) antigens/antibodies (Ag/Ab), hepatitis C Ab, and hepatitis B surface Ag were within normal ranges (non-reactive 0.24, 0.08, and 0.23, respectively, negative if less than 1.0 and positive if more than 1.0). A urine analysis was negative for ketones, proteins, glucose, white cell and red cell counts, and bacteria. Throat, urine, stool, and rectal swab cultures were all negative.Histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical staining of the anal lesion biopsy specimen showed the presence of histiocytoid cells that tested positive for CD1a and S100 protein, while CD3 and CD68 revealed scattered positivity, consistent with LCH. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), Gram, and acid-fast stain were non-revealing.A colonoscopy showed the presence of an established circumferential, fungating rectal tumor of 1 cm diameter with no luminal obstruction.He received intravenously administered chemotherapy with vinblastine 10 mg on day 1 and day 15 along with orally administered prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg per day). After three cycles, magnetic resonance imaging of his abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of disease in the rectosigmoid region. A CT scan of his chest revealed the presence of emphysema in both upper and lower lobes with fibrotic changes. He received two additional cycles of vinblastine 10 mg every 2 weeks then vinblastine 10 mg every 3 weeks. After four cycles of treatment, a CT scan of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed disease progression with honeycombing in both apices of his lungs with bilateral perianal infiltration. Colonoscopy revealed multiple colonic nodules from the rectum to the cecal region, with sigmoid ulceration. A histopathologic study of the sigmoid colon biopsy specimen showed a chorionic and submucosal infiltration with histiocytoid cells with clear cytoplasm and abundant surrounding eosinophils and few lymphocytoid cells consistent with the known diagnosis of histiocytosis X (Fig. 3). Histopathologic study of the anal biopsy specimen showed an acanthotic hyperparakeratotic mucosa that was discretely eroded with no evidence of malignant cells. He then received cytarabine 100 mg administered intravenously weekly plus vinblastine 10 mg administered intravenously every 2 weeks. After 14 cycles of treatment, re-evaluation with a CT scan of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous contrast administration showed disease at the thoracic level with evidence of micronodules in the upper lobe of his right lung. At the pelvic level, there was no evidence of rectal tumor recurrence, with significant (>60%) decrease in the size of colonic nodules. Treatment was continued for an additional 15 cycles, with good treatment tolerance and no clinical evidence of vinblastine-related neurotoxicity. Orally administered steroids were slowly tapered to 10 mg daily. After the 15th cycle of treatment, he was hospitalized for rectorrhagia, but a CT scan of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any evidence of disease progression. On colonoscopy, a decrease in the size of the anal lesion was noticed without anal stenosis and the anal sphincter was less taken by the tumor. Repeat histopathologic examination of the colonic biopsy specimen showed persistent histiocytosis, but a biopsy of the anal polyp showed the presence of a hemorrhoidal fibroma (Fig. 4).

The regimen was well tolerated with no hospitalizations for neutropenic fever or pancytopenia. A colonoscopy showed a normal colonic mucosa with disappearance of colorectal nodules, with few benign-appearing perianal micropolyps (Fig. 5). A repeat CT scan of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenously administered contrast confirmed the colonoscopic results with no evidence of anal and perianal lesions. Lung findings were stable compared to previous results. An additional file shows a timeline for our patient (see Additional file 1).                                      Fig. 5                      Anal orifice showing complete resolution of the histiocytic lesions with persistence of benign-appearing perianal micropolypsAfter completion of all cycles of chemotherapy, he was seen every 2 weeks in the out-patients clinic for a total of 6 months. He was clinically stable with no major complaints. Serial laboratory tests including a complete blood cell count with differentials, renal function, and electrolytes were within normal ranges. Follow up confirmed complete disappearance of the GI lesions and significant improvement of the pulmonary symptoms. Later, he was lost to follow up and could not be reached.DISCUSSION: Adult LCH is rare and many cases remain undiagnosed. The age of onset in adults varied between 21 and 77 years [4, 5]. Some studies reported a female gender predominance [6], while others showed a slight male preponderance [4] or a more even gender distribution [7].LCH can affect only one site in the body or may involve multiple sites or organs. One Germany-based registry reported LCH in adult patients affecting – in decreasing order of frequency – the bone, skin, pituitary, liver/spleen, brain, and the GI tract, the latter accounting for only 2% of cases [8].Histiocytosis X originates from a myeloid dendritic cell giving rise to abnormal Langerhans cells that proliferate at a moderate rate. Histopathologic evaluation of suspicious lesions as well as immunohistochemical examination are necessary for a final diagnosis. Typically, histiocytic cells stain positive for CD1a and S100.Clinical presentation depends on the site of involvement. In pulmonary LCH, patients often complain of non-productive cough and dyspnea, constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss, or eventually chest pain from spontaneous pneumothorax. Tobacco smoking was reported in many series to be a major contributory factor in pulmonary LCH [9–11]. In the GI tract, the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, and perianal skin may be affected [6, 12–14]. Most cases have been diagnosed by GI endoscopy, and up to 50% of patients were asymptomatic [6]. The distribution of the lesions in the GI tract varies, being most common in the colorectum [6]. In the majority of adults, LCH is typically encountered as a solitary polyp [6, 15], and usually occurs without multisystem involvement. However, isolated polyps in the stomach, small bowel, rectum, or colon are extremely rare, the latter being reported only in two cases [15] up to the year 2012. Multiple polyposis due to LCH of the stomach was reported in adults [15]. Lesions are predominantly intramucosal with either a marginated or infiltrative growth pattern. The overlying mucosa could become ulcerated or necrotic. The colonic submucosal infiltration seen in our patient is an unusual clinical finding. Anal involvement by LCH in the adult population is even rarer, and most reported cases were perianal lesions, around the anal orifice, and mainly limited to the perianal skin [12, 13]. Similar cases with anal fistula were reported in pediatric patients [14].To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of adult LCH involving the lungs and the colorectoanal part of the GI tract and presenting as multiple polyposis of the colon and rectum with multiple anal lesions infiltrating the anal sphincter and extending to the perianal region and skin, which showed complete response to chemotherapy.The treatment of adult LCH is not standardized due to the rarity of the disease and the incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology. Vinblastine, a commonly used medication in pediatric LCH, is less favored in adults because of the risk of neurotoxicity. Despite this, our patient had a very good response to vinblastine but had disease recurrence once vinblastine administration was delayed to every 3 weeks instead of 2 weeks. Cytarabine at a dose of 100 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days every month for a duration of 6 months has been used in adult LCH. Our patient received a total of 29 cycles of cytarabine plus vinblastine, with a very good clinical tolerability, without evidence of neurotoxicity or neutropenic fever, and had significantly less extensive involvement of the colorectum with partial regression of the anal lesion. After eight cycles of gemcitabine 1400 mg plus cisplatin 50 mg every 2 weeks, a chemotherapy regimen not previously used or reported for treatment of adult LCH, complete resolution of the colorectal, anal, and perianal lesions occurred. Treatment options in case reports concerning perianal involvement in LCH varied between surgical excision [13], successful use of thalidomide [16], Leustatin (cladribine), and radiotherapy with maintenance adiuretin [17], single agent imatinib or MACOP-B protocol (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, methotrexate, bleomycin, and prednisone) with variable efficacy [18]. Combination gemcitabine plus cisplatin has not been previously reported and deserves further consideration in the management of similar lesions. Its use as first-line treatment in this group of patients has not been previously tested.Overall prognosis in LCH seems to be favorable. A retrospective analysis [19] of 35 patients with LCH with multisystem involvement who received combination chemotherapy showed a 3-year overall survival of 81% ± 10% in patients aged 14 years and above. The overall survival of patients with LCH with GI tract involvement has not been specifically studied.CONCLUSION:Adult multiple polyposis in the colon, rectum, and anus due to LCH of the GI tract in association with pulmonary LCH is an extremely rare clinical entity. Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Long-term cytarabine plus vinblastine has shown acceptable tolerability. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination chemotherapy is a reasonable treatment option that was associated with complete resolution of the GI tract lesions.;

Leptospirosis is endemic in tropical regions and extremely rare in the urban areas of Japan. Only six new cases were reported in Tokyo in 2014. Most leptospirosis cases reported in urban areas of Japan were a result of occupational hazards, and there is no previous report of leptospirosis in a homeless patient in Tokyo. We believe this report could provide a widened perspective about the clinical presentation and epidemiology of leptospirosis in Japan.CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 73-year-old Asian man. He had been homeless for over 10 years, with exposure to rodents and their excrement in parks and on the streets. He presented with fever and severe inflammatory response, satisfying the diagnostic criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Laboratory findings showed multiple-organ dysfunction, including renal failure, liver failure with increased total bilirubin level, and coagulopathy with decreased platelets. We suspected leptospirosis on the basis of these clinical findings. The diagnosis was also confirmed by polymerase chain reaction first, and paired antibody titers on day 9, in the recovery period, showed positive results for three species.CONCLUSION: Our patient’s case suggests that even patients without a history of traveling abroad or exposure to freshwater can develop leptospirosis in winter in urban areas in Japan. If a patient has symptoms like fever, calf pain and MOF, as a differential diagnosis we should rule outthe Leptospirosis. From the perspective of sensitivity, specificity, and clinical convenience, polymerase chain reaction could be the preferred diagnostic tool of choice.;INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira, a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium belonging to the Spirochaetaceae family. Leptospira can survive multiple months in freshwater or wet soil. The infectious cycle is maintained in nature by chronic infection of the renal tubules of maintenance hosts [1], the most important of which are small mammals. Symptoms of leptospirosis are highly variable, and the disease can manifest as fever, chills, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, conjunctival suffusion, and rash, among others [2]. The great majority of infections caused by leptospires are either subclinical or of very mild severity, and patients are unlikely to seek medical attention [3]. However, the severity of leptospirosis can vary greatly, ranging from mild, flu-like illness to fatal hemorrhagic forms with severe involvement of vital organs such as the liver, lungs, and kidneys [4]. These cases can lead to multiple organ failure or other complications and may require hemodiafiltration [5] or mechanical ventilation [6]. We encountered a patient with Weil’s disease (severe leptospirosis) who was thought to have been infected in unspecified public spaces in Tokyo in December. Generally, most cases of leptospirosis in Japan occur in Okinawa, located in the southern area of Japan, via exposure to freshwater. Leptospirosis in urban areas in Japan has been thought to be extremely rare, and there has been no previous report in the literature of a homeless patient with leptospirosis. In this report, we describe a recent case of a patient with Weil’s disease in which the patient was thought to have been infected in the public spaces in Tokyo.CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old Asian man was transferred to our hospital complaining of malaise and inability to move. His past medical history included tuberculosis in childhood, but at the point of admission he was not being treated with any medication. He had been living as a homeless man for more than 10 years in Tokyo, where he had been eating food discarded from restaurants around Shibuya and Nakano and had been staying in public parks such as Jingu-Gaien during the night. He recalled that rodents such as rats had been present around his places of residence. He had not been eating well up to a few days before hospitalization.His physical examination revealed that his height was 157cm and his body weight was 48.6kg. His level of consciousness, based on the Glasgow Coma Scale, was E4V4M6. His axillary temperature was 38°C, his blood pressure was 127/64mmHg, his respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min, and his heart rate was 102 beats/min. He reported tenderness in bilateral lower limbs. His left lower calf was red and warm compared with the right side. Other than his impaired level of consciousness, no significant findings were apparent during his neurological examination.His blood test results were aspartate aminotransferase, 272IU/L, alanine aminotransferase, 153IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase, 675IU/L, creatine kinase, 9048IU/L, blood urea nitrogen, 122.9mg/dl, creatinine, 5.11mg/dl, C-reactive protein (CRP), 16.02mg/dl, sodium, 135mEq/L, white blood cells, 15,000/μl, hemoglobin, 10.9g/dl, platelets, 3.9×104/μl, and fibrinogen, 814mg/dl. Other test results are shown in Table 1. The remainder of the examination results were normal, such as blood levels of potassium, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrin degradation products. Chest radiography and abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed nothing significant.Table 1                      Laboratory findings                     Patient’s valuesNormal laboratory valuesBlood cell count White blood cells15,030/μl4000–9000/μl Red blood cells3.66×104/μl4.1–5.3×104/μl Hemoglobin10.9g/dl14–17g/dl Hematocrit30.3%39–52% Mean corpuscular volume82.8fl84–95fl Mean corpuscular hemoglobin29.8pg27–32pg Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration36g/dl32–36g/dl Platelets3.9×104/μl1.5–3.5×104/μl Neutrophils95.9%48–61% Lymphocytes2.6%25–45% Monocytes1.4%4.0–7.0% Eosinophils0%1.0–5.0% Basophils0.1%0.0–0.1%Coagulation Prothrombin time11.9s9.8–12.4s International normalized ratio10.9–1.16 Activated partial thromboplastin time28.3s26.5–38.1s Fibrinogen814mg/dl130–316mg/dl FDP8.9μg/ml1.5–3.5μg/mlBiochemistry Albumin3.2g/dl3.9–5.1g/dl Total bilirubin1.3mg/dl0.2–1.2mg/dl AST272IU/L13–33IU/L ALT153IU/L8.0–42IU/L LDH675IU/L119–229IU/L ALP331IU/L115–359IU/L γ-GTP62IU/L10–47IU/L Creatine kinase9048IU/L62–287IU/L Blood urea nitrogen122.9mg/dl8.0–20mg/dl Creatinine5.11mg/dl0.61–1.04mg/dl eGFR9.5ml/min/1.73m2 Cl−93mEq/L98–108mEq/L Na+135mEq/L135–145mEq/L K+3.9mEq/L3.6–5.0mEq/L Ca2+8mg/dl8.6–10.1mg/dl Blood sugar132mg/dl70–109mg/dl C-reactive protein16.02mg/dl0.0–0.3mg/dlBlood gas analysis (venous blood, room air) pH7.447.35–7.45 PaCO230mmHg35–45mmHg Base excess−3.8mmol/L−2mmol/L to 2mmol/L HCO3−20.4mmol/L22–26mmol/L Blood sugar127mg/dl70–109mg/dl Lactate1.4mmol/L0.5–2.0mmol/LUrinalysis pH55.0–7.0 Urine-specific gravity1.0131.005–1.030 Protein1+– Occult blood3+– White blood cells+/−–                    ALP alkaline phosphatase, ALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, CRP C-reactive protein, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, FDP fibrin degradation products, γ-GTP γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, PaCO                        2                       partial pressure of carbon dioxideThe clinical course of the patient is shown in Fig. 1. His condition satisfied the diagnostic criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome [7]. Severe sepsis was diagnosed and he was admitted to the critical care unit. Blood, urine and sputum cultures were collected and analyzed with no significant findings. Although the laboratory test results for this patient showed marked multi-organ involvement, the constellation of characteristic features of high fever, lower calf pain, elevated white blood cell count, elevated CRP level, acute renal failure, liver failure and thrombocytopenia suggested a strong possibility of leptospirosis than other etiologies. The patient also had a history of exposure to rodents and their excrement, so we considered leptospirosis as the first diagnostic option and started antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone (4g/day). On day 2, fever and redness and warmth of the left lower calf disappeared. On day 3, maximal axillary temperature was 37°C, and the patient did not subsequently present with fever.                                      Fig. 1                      The patient’s clinical course. His total bilirubin (T-Bil) continued to increase, reaching 8.1mg/dl on day 7 and peaking after that. His serum creatinine (Cr) was 5.1mg/dl on the day of admission and subsequently showed continuous improvement. His C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 16.02mg/dl on day 1 but continued to decrease and was within the normal range by day 12. His platelet (Plt) count was 3.9×104/μl on the day of admission, reaching a minimum value of 0.8×104/μl on day 3. After that, his platelets started to increase and normalized by day 9. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) was initially administered at 2 grams every 12 hours, with the dosage changed on day 8.In contrast, the patient’s thrombocytopenia progressed, and his platelet count on day 3 was 8000/μl. Although his platelet count was low, no clinical signs of bleeding were identified. Because thrombocytopenia in leptospirosis is transient and does not result from disseminated intravascular coagulation [8], we decided not to perform a transfusion immediately. Recovery was seen starting from day 4 and had normalized by day 9. His total bilirubin level continued to rise, reaching 8.1mg/dl on day 7 before starting to decrease, and reaching 4.7mg/dl on day 14.Regarding renal failure, 24-h urine collection was performed to evaluate the cause. His fractional excretion of sodium was 7.91%, his osmotic pressure of urine was 383mOsm/kg, and his total urine output was 3970ml/day. Adequate fluid was administered, and his creatinine level normalized to 0.98mg/dl on day 7. On day 2, hypokalemia was found in laboratory testing and was attributed to non-oliguric renal failure. We continued to administer potassium intravenously (20–40mEq/L/day) until day 5, when his potassium level reached 3.0mEq/L. During the admission, there was no compliance issue. On day 16, the patient was discharged without major complications.Serum and urine samples taken on hospital days 2 and 9 were subjected to microscopic agglutination testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. In the PCR, we used a portion of the flaB gene coding for the flagellar protein of leptospires. Microscopic agglutination testing was performed with a panel of 15 live leptospires representing the main serovars commonly reported in Japan. Antibody titers against 16 Leptospira spp. in the serum sample from hospital day 2 were all under 50U/ml. However, PCR with serum and urine specimens yielded positive results, confirming the diagnosis of leptospirosis. We were later notified that titers of antibodies against L. borgpetersenii serovar Poi, L. interrogans serovar Hebdomadis, and L. interrogans serovar Kremastos in the serum sample from hospital day 9 were elevated to 400–1600 U/ml (Table 2).Table 2                      Microscopic agglutination test results                    AntigensAgglutination titers, U/mlSpeciesSerovarHospital day 2Hospital day 9                            Leptospira borgpetersenii                          Castellonis<50<200                            Leptospira borgpetersenii                          Javanica<50<200                            Leptospira borgpetersenii                          Poi<501600                            Leptospira interrogans                          Australis<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Autumnalis<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Bataviae<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Canicola<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Copenhageni<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Hebdomadis<50400                            Leptospira interrogans                          Icterohaemorrhagiae<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Kremastos<50400                            Leptospira interrogans                          Pomona<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Pyrogenes<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Rachmati<50<200                            Leptospira interrogans                          Grippotyphosa<50<200DISCUSSION: We suspected leptospirosis in this case on the basis of the constellation of characteristic features and laboratory results. Therefore, we could administer an appropriate antibiotic option starting from day 1 and collect specimens for specific tests. Thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, elevated total bilirubin, and severe inflammatory reaction are not uncommon features of severe leptospirosis previously reported in Japan, and several cases required transient hemodialysis owing to uremic symptoms.Severe cases of leptospirosis, or Weil’s disease, are treated using antibiotics such as penicillin G, cefotaxime, doxycycline, and ceftriaxone [9]. Reports have suggested that ceftriaxone and sodium penicillin G are equally effective for the treatment of severe leptospirosis [10]. We therefore selected ceftriaxone as the first-line treatment option. As a result, the condition of the patient responded very well and the therapeutic results were satisfying.The diagnosis of leptospirosis can be made on the basis of culture, serology, and PCR. Leptospires require delicate and complex culture media. The media must contain several growth-promoting substances and selected antimicrobial agents to suppress contaminants. Culturing leptospires is thus laborious, expensive, and tedious [11]. The serological method, however, is neither sensitive nor specific during the first week of illness [12], and paired serum samples are required for serological diagnosis in patients such as ours. In our patient, we performed both PCR and serology tests. PCR confirmed the diagnosis of leptospirosis first, followed by antibody titers during the recovery period that showed positive results for three species.CONCLUSION:Only six new cases of leptospirosis were reported in Tokyo in 2014 [13]. Several case reports and a literature review about leptospirosis in Japanese urban areas have been published. This case report is the first, to the best of our knowledge, about leptospirosis in a homeless patient in an urban area of Tokyo. Major causes of infection in previous reports were occupational hazards or continuous contacts with rats inside the patients’ own houses [14]. Leptospirosis in the present case was probably caused by exposure to urine from rats inhabiting the parks and streets of Tokyo. This suggests that rodents inhabiting public spaces in Tokyo represent an infectious reservoir for leptospirosis. In addition, this case arose in December, a winter month in Japan, even though most cases of leptospirosis in Japan are typically encountered in summer.Leptospirosis should not be ruled out in patients with characteristic symptoms, signs, and laboratory results, even in the absence of a history of travel abroad or exposure to freshwater. In addition, PCR offers an effective and quick diagnostic method when serological diagnostic methods cannot confirm the diagnosis. However, to ensure a high sensitivity, samples have to be obtained before or shortly after the start of antibiotic therapy because antimicrobial agents quickly remove Leptospira from the blood [15].;

Upon discontinuing anticoagulant, he had a subsequent central retinal artery occlusion in the other eye. Optical coherence tomography angiography images were obtained to compare the retinal microvasculature in both eyes.CONCLUSION: Atrophy of the involved retina continues for several weeks after central retinal artery occlusion but the loss of retinal capillaries is immediate and stable over time. The presence of cilioretinal arteries that perfuse the central macula can prevent profound vision loss.;INTRODUCTION: Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an important vascular cause of serious vision loss. The incidence of non-arteritic CRAO is estimated to be 1 in 100,000 people [1] and most result in profound vision loss [2]. Despite being a well-recognized ophthalmic emergency [3], limited progress has been made in diagnostic evaluations. Studies suggest that CRAO lasting approximately 240 minutes results in irreparable retinal damage [3, 4].Fluorescein angiography (FA) has been a standard method in assessing retinal vasculature and diseases such as CRAO [5]. Sodium fluorescein is given intravenously and the fluorescence emitted from retinal and choroidal circulation is detected on angiography. CRAO can be diagnosed clinically with common funduscopic findings such as diffuse retinal edema, “cherry-red spot,” “box-carring,” or attenuation of the vessels [6, 7]. The delayed filling of the affected vessels on FA confirms the diagnosis. However, FA is invasive and relatively contraindicated in pregnancy or chronic kidney failure. In addition, the visualizations of retinal vasculature are limited with this imaging [5]. Recently, the introduction of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has shown promising results in allowing noninvasive functional imaging of retinal vasculature [8]. With this imaging modality, both structural and functional changes of the retina can be assessed.Optical coherence tomography-based microangiography (OMAG) is an OCTA algorithm and has been used for evaluation of various retinal diseases [9, 10]. With this technology, the retinal microvasculature can be visualized, quantified, and dissected in various layers. There has been increasing interest in evaluating the area of retinal ischemia following retinal arterial occlusions using structural images of spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) without the angiography component [5, 11]. Using OMAG, the superficial, intermediate, and deeper retinal capillary plexus can be visualized in vivo in addition to structural images. The purpose of this case report is to describe key retinal structure changes and vasculature findings in a case of bilateral CRAOs using fundus photo, SD-OCT, and OMAG.CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old white man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy status post-heart transplant presented with acute loss of vision in his right eye for 1 week, no history of polymyalgia rheumatica, and no scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, proximal muscle weakness, or temporal headache. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 eccentrically in his right eye and 20/25 in his left eye. Fundus imaging showed several Hollenhorst plaques and diffuse whitening of his retina except for the nasal macula (Fig. 1a). FA was not obtained due to severe chronic renal insufficiency.                                          Fig. 1                        Fundus color photographs of both eyes. a One week after foveal-sparing central retinal artery occlusion in the right eye, diffuse macular edema is present except for nasal parafovea and perifovea. Hollenhorst plaque is noted. b Four days after the central retinal artery occlusion in the left eye, diffuse macular edema is noted with cherry red spot. The nasal and temporal peripapillary retina are unaffected. c Three months after the central retinal artery occlusion in the right there is attenuation of the arter﻿ioles. d Three months after the central retinal artery occlusion in the left eyeHe underwent a stroke workup including a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), carotid Doppler, echocardiogram, and magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) of his brain. Of note, his platelet count was 148×103/uL, ESR 21, and CRP was 7.4 mg/L. An approximate 90 % stenosis at the origin of his innominate artery with 30 % stenosis of the right carotid bulb was found. He underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of his innominate artery and was placed on a daily dose of aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg), however, he stopped the medicine due to poor tolerance.Four months after the CRAO in his right eye and a few weeks after discontinuing clopidogrel, he had another episode of acute painless vision loss involving his left, previously unaffected, eye. At this time, his visual acuity was 20/30 eccentrically in his right eye and 20/400 in his left eye. A funduscopic examination 4 days after the episode of his left eye revealed diffuse whitening of his retina with a cherry red spot (Fig. 1b). A repeat workup was unremarkable and he was restarted on clopidogrel. Fundus photographs were repeated three months after the CRAO in each eye (Fig. 1c, d).He underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination and color fundus imaging (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) tests and SD-OCT imaging (Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) tests whenever possible during his initial visit and follow-up visits. In addition, OMAG imaging was obtained subsequently using a modified SD-OCT (CIRRUS prototype provided by Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA, USA) with a central wavelength of 850 nm and a speed of 100,000 A-scans per second.The details of OMAG scanning protocol and algorithm have been described previously [9]. The complex version of the OMAG algorithm was applied to the images that were extracted. The retinal images were segmented into three different retinal layers using a semi-automated algorithm: an inner retinal layer from the ganglion cell layer to the inner plexiform layer, a middle retinal layer from the inner nuclear layer to the outer plexiform layer, and an outer retinal layer from the external limiting membrane and the outer nuclear layer. The three-dimensional structure of the retina was projected using Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).The mean retinal thickness was measured by calculating the average of five consecutive scans. The macula was divided into nine zone Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grids: parafovea, inner/outer nasal, inner/outer temporal, inner/outer superior, and inner/outer inferior. Perfusion index was defined as the percent coverage of the area by retinal vessels with flow. For his right eye, the perfusion indices were compared between two subsequent visits following the foveal-sparing CRAO. For his left eye, the perfusion indices before and after CRAO were compared.SD-OCT imaging was obtained at 1, 3, 5, and 7 months after the foveal-sparing CRAO in his right eye (Fig. 2a–d). Both superficial and deep retinal layer thickness decreased in the involved temporal macula compared to the nasal macula. Mean retinal thickness temporal to fovea (500 μm away from the foveal center) in his right eye at months 1, 3, 5, and 7 was 250 μm, 204 μm, 194 μm, and 191 μm, respectively. OMAG images of his right eye at 1 and 3 months are shown in Fig. 3a, c. OMAG images of his left eye prior to the CRAO and 1 month after the CRAO are shown In Fig. 3b, d.

Color schemes are based on the anatomical depth with green color being the most superficial followed by yellow and redSD-OCT imaging was obtained on day 4 and at 1 month, 3 months, and 5 months after the CRAO in his left eye. (Fig. 2e–h) On day 4, there was diffuse edema involving both superficial and deep retinal layers. Mean retinal thickness temporal to fovea (660 μm away from the foveal center) was 504 μm. Follow-up images of the same area revealed thicknesses of 246 μm, 215 μm, and 196 μm, at months 1, 3, and 5, respectively.Perfusion indices showed no significant difference during two consecutive visits after the CRAO in his right eye (Fig. 4). The perfusion indices in all zones were below 40 except for the inner and outer nasal ETDRS zones which were unaffected by the CRAO. There was a statistically significant difference in the perfusion indices of all nine zones before and after the CRAO in his left eye (p-value <0.001, Fig. 4). The average perfusion index in the eight non-central zones prior to the CRAO was 40 (range 39 to 45) while the average perfusion index after the CRAO in the non-central zones was 20 (range 10 to 30).

CF central fovea, ETDRS Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, II inner inferior, IN inner nasal, IS inner superior, IT inner temporal, OI outer inferior, ON outer nasal, OS outer superior, OT outer temporalThe retinal vasculature loss following CRAO was acute and permanent, but the retinal atrophy progressed over several months. In our patient, the thickness of inner retina continued to decrease until month 5, but then it stabilized on follow-up visits. However, the structural architecture of nasal retina remained undisrupted by SD-OCT throughout the follow-up period. OMAG images showed severe loss of all retinal microvasculature involving intermediate and deep plexus more than the superficial plexus. The en face OMAG images obtained at months 1 and 3 demonstrated visible absence of the retinal microvasculature in his right eye except for the nasal macula (Fig. 3a, c). The en face OMAG image obtained at month 1 after the CRAO in the left eye revealed loss of retinal capillary plexus in the entire macula (Fig. 3d).Even though the FA is a standard imaging modality in evaluating retinal vascular diseases, FA is often not possible due to time commitment and patient factors such as renal insufficiency. Although FA would have been diagnostic in our patient, it was deferred due to chronic renal insufficiency. Contraindications for FA include fluorescein allergy, renal failure, pregnancy, moderate-severe asthma, and significant cardiac cases [12]. The noninvasive nature of OCTA is advantageous in many of our patients with multiple comorbidities. In addition, the image quality can vary due to media opacity such as cataract and patient cooperation. Smaller capillaries and deeper retinal plexus are not visible with FA. In contrast, OCTA provides a safe and potentially superior alternative method of assessing total retinal vasculature.Recently, retinal artery occlusions were characterized as superficial and/or intermediate and deep capillary plexus ischemia using SD-OCT images [11]. In particular, the ischemia within the intermediate and deeper retinal capillary plexus were described as a hyper-reflective lesion at the level of the inner nuclear layer and referred to as paracentral acute middle maculopathy [13]. The characteristic ischemia in the inner retina cannot be presumed based only on the change in the reflective pattern seen on SD-OCT, but OCTA allows for direct visualization of perfusion and quantification. Thus, the vascular change evident on OCTA such as OMAG could become an important clinical endpoint in future studies.Our patient had extensive involvement of all three retinal capillary plexuses. In particular, the loss of vasculature in the deep capillary plexus appeared more profound in the ischemic areas compared to the perfused nasal retina supplied by the cilioretinal artery in both eyes. Unfortunately, the cilioretinal artery of our patient’s left eye did not supply the fovea, thus he had more profound vision loss in this eye. The presence of cilioretinal arteries that contribute to the macula has been previously reported in 18.7 % of patients [14], but there is high variability in the number, vessel caliber, and location of cilioretinal arteries in the general public.Perfusion indices are potentially objective values that can be followed over time. These values can be interpreted as the areas of significant flow and low numbers would indicate either decreased flow or area of ischemia. In our analysis, the perfusion index was calculated using the perfusion percentage within independently subsampled areas of the retina. This method allowed the quantification of the OCTA signal per each ETDRS zone leading to a more robust quantification.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of OCTA imaging in bilateral CRAO and comparison of the OCTA imaging before and after CRAO. OCTA provides important information regarding vascular changes including hypoperfusion, ischemia, and abnormal structure. However, the lack of standardizations, the lack of full understanding of the artifacts, and the lack of large trials to determine the clinical relevance of image findings are the main current limitations. Despite these challenges, OCTA such as OMAG will probably become an effective adjunct modality in diagnosing and following retinal vascular diseases.DISCUSSION: A 75-year-old white man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy status post-heart transplant presented with acute loss of vision in his right eye for 1 week, no history of polymyalgia rheumatica, and no scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, proximal muscle weakness, or temporal headache.

Infections, drugs, pregnancy, bone marrow transplantation, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders have all been reported to trigger episodes of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of an association between diabetic ketoacidosis and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 26-year-old Spanish man who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis and was found to have the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. The patient had a normal ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity level, and his renal biopsy demonstrated predominant changes of diabetic glomerulosclerosis with an area compatible with thrombotic microangiopathy suggestive of superimposed atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Complement sequencing subsequently revealed a potential causative mutation in exon 12 of complement factor B with changes of lysine at amino acid position 533 to an arginine (CFB p.K533R).CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of diabetic ketoacidosis presenting with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with a variant of complement factor B in an adult patient.;INTRODUCTION: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. The majority of the cases are seen in childhood and are caused by Shiga-like toxin (so-called typical HUS). Non-Shiga toxin-associated HUS (atypical HUS, or aHUS) is known to be caused by dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway due to genetic mutations or neutralizing autoantibodies [1]. Infections, drugs, pregnancy, bone marrow transplantation, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders have all been reported to trigger episodes of aHUS [1]. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of an association between diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and aHUS. We report a case of an adult patient with DKA presenting with aHUS associated with a variant of complement factor B (CFB).CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old Hispanic man with a history of type 1 diabetes that had been diagnosed between 12 and 14 years of age was brought to the emergency department (ED) after two episodes of new-onset seizures at home. A family member reported that the patient had stopped taking insulin for 1 day before presentation. He complained of epigastric pain and nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting at home. In the ED, the patient had another two episodes of tonic-clonic seizures.His physical examination revealed that he was agitated, febrile (body temperature 38.5 °C), hypertensive (blood pressure 149/87 mmHg), and tachycardiac (heart rate 105 beats/minute). The remainder of his physical examination was unremarkable. His laboratory data (Table 1) were remarkable for hyperglycemia and high anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated β-hydroxybutyrate level compatible with DKA. No central nervous system pathology was revealed by a computed tomographic scan of his brain without intravenous contrast or by a lumbar puncture. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for management of DKA. His ketoacidosis resolved within 24 hours on intravenous fluids and an insulin drip. However, he continued to remain very drowsy in spite of correction of the DKA. Repeat laboratory data showed anemia (hemoglobin 9.1 g/dl, baseline value 11.8 g/dl 2 months prior), thrombocytopenia (150 × 109/L, baseline value 416 × 109/L 2 months prior), acute kidney injury with a blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio of 33/3.4 mg/dl (baseline value 40/1.4 mg/dl 2 months prior), and evidence of hemolysis (lactate dehydrogenase 1700 IU/L, indirect bilirubin 1.7 mg/dl) with schistocytes present on his peripheral blood smear. His presentation strongly suggested the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/HUS, and emergent, empiric plasmapheresis was initiated while awaiting the result for the ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity level. His additional serologic workup results, including complement components C3 and C4, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cryoglobulins, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, and hepatitis B and C panels, were normal or negative.Table 1                      Hematological and chemistry laboratory values                    Parameter (reference range)Admission (day 0)Postplasmapheresis (day 5)Initiation of eculizumab (6 weeks after)WBC, 109/L127.25.3Hb, g/dl9.18.28.0Platelets, 109/L150219202Serum Na+, mEq/L142135130Serum K+, mEq/L4.45.55.6Serum bicarbonate, mEq/L72627BUN, mg/dl333466Creatinine, mg/dl3.43.65.6Glucose, mg/dl520––Indirect bilirubin, mg/dl (0.2–0.8)1.70.7–LDH, IU/L1700763–Haptoglobin, mg/dl (43–212)<15––pH7.33––Anion gap20––β-Hydroxybutyrate, mmol/L (0.02–0.27)1.21––ADAMTS1381 %––SchistocytesPresentNone–Urinalysis    pH6.0   Protein, mg/dl>300   Glucose, mg/dl>1000–– RBC25–30/HPF   WBC0–3/HPF   Granular case5–10/HPF                                                       ADAMTS13 a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13, BUN blood urea nitrogen, Hb hemoglobin, HPF high-power field, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, RBC red blood cells, WBC white blood cellsThe patient responded with a dramatic improvement in mental status and hemolytic parameters after 5 days of plasmapheresis (Table 1).

His anti-complement factor H (anti-CFH) antibody result was negative. His renal biopsy showed moderate to severe nodular diabetic glomerulosclerosis with superimposed thrombotic microangiopathy in a single glomerulus, suggestive of superimposed aHUS (Fig. 1). Complement sequencing of the coding regions of CFH, complement factor I (CFI), CFB, C3, membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), diacylglycerol kinase ε, and thrombomodulin was completed. A heterozygous, nonsynonymous variant was identified in exon 12 of CFB with changes of a lysine at amino acid position 533 to an arginine (CFB p.K533R). The patient was started on treatment with eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting complement component C5, after he received meningococcal vaccine. He had no further episode of DKA or aHUS during 5 months of follow-up after initiation of eculizumab therapy. However, his renal function gradually deteriorated and hemodialysis was started (Table 1, Fig. 2). He is currently being evaluated for kidney transplant.

DKA diabetic ketoacidosis, ESRD end-stage renal disease, HD hemodialysis, TMA thrombotic microangiopathyDISCUSSION: Extensive research has established an association between aHUS and the alternative complement pathway. It has been reported that mutations in the genes encoding proteins regulating the alternative complement pathway may result in abnormal activation of this pathway. It could be due to loss-of-function mutations in CFH, MCP, and CFI by either nonsense or missense mutations or by gain-of-function mutations in C3 and CFB [1]. Under normal circumstances, the CFB gene encodes the factor B protein, which is a component of C3 convertase, C3bBb, and catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. Genetic mutations in the CFB gene may cause either enhanced formation of C3 convertase or increase its resistance to inactivation, thus leading to uncontrolled hyperactivity of the alternative complement pathway. CFB mutations have previously been reported to be associated with aHUS at a frequency as high as 1.4 % [2]. Table 2 lists all the previously reported cases with CFB mutations in patients with aHUS, the majority of these reported patients were children. The first two mutations in CFB gene F286L in exon 6 and K323E in exon 7 are both gain-of-function mutations that enhance the formation of C3 convertase [3, 4]. The CFB mutation (p.Lys350Asn) reported by Funato and colleagues causes resistance to decay acceleration factor and therefore increases C3bBb stability [5].Table 2                      Previously reported CFB mutations in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome reported in the English-language literature                    Case reportsSexAgeMutation, amino acid changeFremeaus-Bacchi et al.

This mutation was previously identified in an 8-year-girl with aHUS reported by Tawadrous and colleagues [4], who believed it to contribute to the pathogenesis of aHUS. Further evidence in favor of the potentially pathogenic effect is the fairly rare minor allele frequency of 0.2 % in the Latino population, in which aHUS is a rare event [6]. More recently, Marinozzi and colleagues [7] performed comprehensive assessment of the p.K508R mutation, a more mature protein of p.K533R after removing the leader peptide, which leads to altered numbering for the same variant. They concluded that p.K508R most likely represents a rare benign polymorphism. Although they acknowledged that the p.K508R variant did confer moderately increased serine protease activity in vitro, they judged it as inadequate to explain the reduction of C3 clinically. On the basis of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards [8], current understanding of the clinical interpretation for this variant is that it is “a variant of uncertain clinical significance.” However, controversies still exist. Therefore, additional studies are required for further clarification of the contribution of this rare variant/polymorphism to the pathogenesis of aHUS. In addition, with new technology, more genetic mutations that contribute to the pathogenesis of aHUS are likely to be identified in the future [9–11]. Therefore, we speculate that the combination of multiple incompletely penetrant variants or a “trigger event” may contribute to the development of aHUS in some cases such as our patient’s.It has been proposed that a “trigger event” or a “second hit” is related to precipitation of an episode of aHUS in a susceptible individual. These individuals may have gene mutations or antibodies to complement proteins that lead to uncontrolled continuous activation of the alternative pathway, resulting in the formation of the membrane attack complex. Various trigger events associated with aHUS have been reported previously, including infections, drugs, malignancy, pregnancy, or autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous, C3 nephritic factor, and anticardiolipin. No obvious infectious etiology was identified in our patient. He was noncompliant with insulin therapy, which may lead to development of DKA. Subsequently, DKA may have been the “trigger event” for the episode of aHUS due to genetic predisposition with the CFB p.K533R variant. However, the possibility that aHUS may have precipitated DKA in our patient cannot be completely ruled out. Studies have shown that hemostatic changes leading to a thrombotic tendency occur during ketoacidosis [12, 13]. In addition, DKA elicits systemic inflammation associated with dysregulation of adhesion molecule expression and cytokine release by endothelial cells [14]. We propose that, in our patient, endothelial cell dysfunction during DKA enhanced the abnormality of endothelial damage and microvascular thrombosis mediated by his abnormal complement activity and further activated the complement pathway, leading to his aHUS episode.Treatment of aHUS has been evolving rapidly with the recent approval of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to the human C5 protein [15, 16]. End-stage renal disease or death was reported to occur in up to 65 % of patients with aHUS before eculizumab was introduced [17]. Eculizumab has been reported to be effective, with improvement of renal function as well as decreased episodes of aHUS. Our patient’s kidney function gradually worsened despite eculizumab therapy, which was likely secondary to progression of diabetic nephropathy because only a small area of superimposed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)  was identified together with moderate to severe nodular diabetic glomerulosclerosis in the kidney biopsy and no further episode of aHUS has occurred since then. He was started on hemodialysis and currently is awaiting evaluation for kidney transplant. The patient will require standard maintenance treatment with lifelong eculizumab because only very limited evidence regarding discontinuation of eculizumab has been reported to date [18].CONCLUSION:To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of DKA presenting with aHUS in an adult patient. We report a potential causative mutation for aHUS: p.K533R in exon 12 of CFB.;
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-018-1617-z;Management of a giant retroperitoneal leiomyoma: a case report;;;INTRODUCTION: Leiomyomas are benign tumors observed mainly in adult women. The retroperitoneum is a rare location for leiomyomas, almost 100 cases have been reported. Because retroperitoneal leiomyomas are paucisymptomatic and the tumor size at diagnosis is relatively large, surgical management is challenging. Regular follow-up is required because recurrence and malignant sarcomatous transformation have been described in a few cases.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 52-year-old North African woman with a 22-cm retroperitoneal leiomyoma. A preoperative embolization was performed 2 days before surgery. The clinical, therapeutic, and evolutive aspects of this rare entity are discussed.CONCLUSION: Despite its benignity, retroperitoneal leiomyoma is a challenging diagnostic, therapeutic, and evolutive condition. Surgeons must consider mainly the tumor’s vascularization. Regular follow-up is mandatory because malignant transformation cannot be excluded.;INTRODUCTION: Retroperitoneal leiomyoma is a rare and benign condition. It is infrequently observed among primary retroperitoneal neoplasms. The diagnostic approach is challenging because retroperitoneal leiomyomas may be confused with renal tumors. Tumor vascularization must be defined and considered before surgery because it usually arises from the aorta and the renal artery. In this report, we describe a case of a patient with a retroperitoneal leiomyoma requiring preoperative arterial embolization. The diagnostic, therapeutic, and evolutive aspects are discussed.CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old North African woman consulted our department with a surgical emergency for recent left flank pain associated with a palpable tender solid mass. The patient is a married mother of three children and working as a secretary in public administration. She did not have any past medical history. She delivered two of her children by cesarean section. She complained of chronic constipation of 6 months’ duration. She was apyretic and did not complain of vomiting or recent disturbance in bowel motility. She had no urinary or gynecological disorders. She did not present with sensory or motor focal deficits or visual or speech disorders. The palpable mass was located in the left flank and the iliac fossa, with a posterior dorsal extension and regular margins. Deep palpation of the mass caused tenderness. The patient had no jaundice, and her urine and feces were not discolored.The patient’s blood test results were normal. Her liver and kidney function was sufficient. Her white blood cell count was 7000/mm3. Her hemoglobin level was 13.5 g/dl. Her platelet count was normal. Her C-reactive protein concentration was 11 mg/L. Her CA-125 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were within normal range.Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a voluminous left-sided heterogeneous tissue abdominopelvic mass with a mass effect on the left kidney. Doppler imaging showed that the tumor was nonvascularized.On an abdominopelvic computed tomographic (CT) scan, the mass measured 16 × 17 × 22 cm. It was well-limited, heterogeneous, and hypervascularized. The vascularization seemed to arise exclusively from the renal artery. The mass effect involved the left kidney and its hilum, the left ureter, the left colon, and the inferior mesenteric vascular axis. The renal vein and the inferior vena cava were permeable (Fig. 1).                                      Fig. 1                      A retroperitoneal tumor with a mass effect on the left kidney, the aorta, and the bowel. 1 = Tumor, 2 = left kidney, 3 = aorta, 4 = left kidney artery, 5 = iliac artery, 6 = pancreasAngiography confirmed the CT findings because the tumor vessels emerged exclusively from the renal artery. Embolization of the renal artery was performed using a transfemoral approach, which led to total disappearance of the tumor vascularization (Fig. 2). The patient had no fever or systemic inflammatory signs after embolization.                                      Fig. 2                      a Abundant and anarchic vascularization of the tumor, provided exclusively from the left renal artery. b Embolization of the renal artery led to complete disappearance of the tumor vascularizationAfter 2 days of opioid analgesia, the patient underwent surgery. A midline incision allowed exploration of the abdominal cavity. The results of the operative exploration were similar to the scan findings. The left kidney was pushed to the median line. The mass seemed to be firmly adherent to the kidney and its hilum. The dissection plane was not obviously identifiable. The tumor had a smaller size after embolization, but it was not dissociable from the kidney. Its manipulation was not particularly hemorrhagic. The first step was the identification of the ureter and clamping of the renal artery and the vein. A thorough dissection of the tumor from adjacent structures was performed, allowing a one-piece resection of the mass with the left kidney (Fig. 3).                                      Fig. 3                      Operative specimen. 1 = Tumor, 2 = left kidney, 3 = tumor capsule, 4 = left kidney capsule, 5 = the kidney’s hilumThe patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged on the fourth postoperative day.Histological examination of the tumor demonstrated it to be a benign mesenchymal proliferation involving regular smooth muscle cells grown in a hypervascularized stroma. Focal hyalinized spots were observed. The mitotic index was not high. No fat cells or necrotic lesions were present (Fig. 4). The tumor proliferation did not involve the renal parenchyma. The results of immunohistochemical analysis were negative for HMB-45, CD117, DOG1, PS100, and CD34. The finding for the Ki-67 proliferation index was also negative. Tumor cells were positive for desmin, caldesmon, and actin, confirming the diagnosis of retroperitoneal leiomyoma (Fig. 5). The kidney and its capsule were free from any histological neoplastic lesions.

The results of her clinical examination were normal. Her renal function was conserved. An abdominal CT scan ruled out any local or distant recurrence.DISCUSSION: We report a new case of a 52-year-old woman with a retroperitoneal leiomyoma. The tumor measured 22 cm, and the CT scan aspects were confused with a voluminous renal tumor. Vascularization was exclusively from the renal artery, which is rarely observed in retroperitoneal leiomyomas. Preoperative embolization of the renal artery 2 days before surgery was performed safely and allowed decrease of the tumor’s size. The tumor was not dissociable from the kidney, and the operative specimen included the retroperitoneal mass and the kidney in one piece. Immunohistochemical markers were distinctive to ensure diagnostic accuracy.Leiomyomas are developed from smooth muscle cells and are rarely located in the retroperitoneum. To the best of our knowledge, around a hundred of cases have been described in the English literature, 40 of them contain sufficient data for study [1].Retroperitoneal smooth muscle cell tumors are often diagnosed fortuitously, and symptoms are related to compression of adjacent structures. The mean size at diagnosis is 12 cm [2]. Eighty percent of them are malignant, represented by leiomyosarcomas [3]. Predicting malignancy of smooth muscle tumors relies on histomorphological evidence, including the tumor size, the margin’s infiltrating character, the important mitotic activity index, and cytological atypia. These criteria may differ, depending on the tumor’s location. Retroperitoneal leiomyomas in female patients may express significant mitotic activity index [4].The pathogenesis of retroperitoneal leiomyomas is still unclear. The role of gonadotropic hormones seems to be influential. The uterine location, the one most often described, occurs mainly during the genital activity period. Up to 40% of retroperitoneal cases are associated with synchronous or previously operated uterine myomas [1]. This theory is particularly plausible because only nine cases have been reported in men [5], and the density of estrogen and mainly of progesterone receptors is remarkably important [6]. Stutterecker et al. described the eventuality of the development of embryonic vessels in remnant musculature. This hypothesis is supported by the previous case reports describing pulmonary and heart locations [7].The diagnosis is rarely established preoperatively [1]. Symptoms are not specific and are related to the mass effect of the tumors [8]. It is important to mention that most retroperitoneal leiomyomas are independent from the uterus in the pelvic floor [1]. They develop in the upper part of the retroperitoneum in 30% of cases [9]. In four patients, the leiomyomas were reported to be in the anterior retroperitoneum, in the Retzius space, or in the adnexa of uterus [5, 10].Ultrasound and CT scan aspects are not evocative. The tumor is usually described as a voluminous, heterogeneous, hypervascularized mass [4]. Preoperative imagery is mainly of interest to define the anatomical limits of the tumor precisely. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to differentiate leiomyoma from leiomyosarcoma, such as in the case of uterine myomas [11].Differential diagnoses concern other spindle cell tumors, such as leiomyosarcomas and stromal tumors. Other rare diagnoses, such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and pleomorphic sarcoma, have been described [4]. Immunohistochemical analysis is of primary importance in this context. The most essential markers, ensuring accurate differentiation between leiomyomatous and stromal tumors particularly, are desmin, CD34, and CD117 [12].Tumor biomarkers, especially the CA-125 and carcinoembryonic antigens, may be elevated in patients with huge tumors. Preoperative documented elevation of these antigens can be helpful in further follow-up [13].Surgery is the only curative option. Open surgery was the option chosen in most of the previously reported retroperitoneal leiomyoma cases. A laparoscopic approach was described in only two cases [1]. The difficulty with laparoscopic or robot-assisted approaches is related mainly to the relatively large tumor size at diagnosis and the adherence to adjacent structures [14]. The principal aim is to ensure a one-piece excision of the tumor and to conserve the integrity of the surrounding organs and large vessels [15]. Once benignity is confirmed histologically, recurrence and malignant transformation are extremely rare [1]. Nevertheless, the few reported cases justify a thorough clinical and radiological follow-up. Other therapeutic options can be discussed on an individual basis. A luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue has been proposed, despite the lack of efficacy and the recurrence of evolutive symptoms upon discontinuation of treatment [16]. Arterial embolization was also described as a preoperative option in patients with huge retroperitoneal tumors. It is useful mainly to reduce operative hemorrhagic incidents and to slightly reduce the tumor size [17]. Surgery should be performed within 2 days, and analgesia must be strengthened because the pain is usually intense [5]. Even though some incidents have been described, such as arterial dissection or systemic embolization, tumor artery embolization is usually a safe technique to facilitate the surgical approach in patients with voluminous or symptomatic retroperitoneal tumors [16]. In our patient, the tumor was totally vascularized from the renal artery, whereas most of the described embolization procedures of the retroperitoneal tumors concerned lumbar arteries and secondarily the renal artery. The presence of a lumbar artery allows sparing of the renal artery from embolization when preoperative imaging confirms the retroperitoneal and extrarenal location of the tumor. Thus, nephrectomy can be avoided.CONCLUSION:Retroperitoneal leiomyoma is a challenging diagnostic and therapeutic situation. Histological diagnosis is usually postoperative because radiological features are not conclusive of benignity. Surgeons must consider the vascularization of the tumor because it may arise from the renal artery in some cases. Thorough clinical and radiological follow-up is required because of the potential malignant transformation.;

Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, his platelet recovery was slow, but did not lead to complications and he did not require platelet transfusion.CONCLUSION: There is no consensus in the medical literature guiding the optimal management of severe thrombocytopenia in typhoid fever, but it may improve with conservative management, as in our case. The epidemiology and management of this condition merits further research to guide clinical practice.;INTRODUCTION: Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi and occasionally Salmonella Paratyphi. Thrombocytopenia is relatively common in typhoid fever, with a reported incidence up to 26% in children. It has been classified as a marker of severity in typhoid fever and indicates a high risk for development of complications [1]. Despite this, its pathophysiology and management in typhoid fever is not well established. We present a case of severe thrombocytopenia in a child with typhoid fever and we discuss the published literature.CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old Asian boy presented to the emergency department at a tertiary children’s hospital in Sydney, Australia, 1 day after returning from travel to Bangladesh with a persistent fever for 10 days. He had visited Bangladesh with his parents and stayed for 8 weeks. He had vomiting, diarrhea, and fever 3 weeks after arriving in Bangladesh, for which he was given oral ciprofloxacin for 3 days. The vomiting and diarrhea resolved after 1 week, but he continued to have intermittent fevers up to 38 °C (100.4 °F) for an additional 2 weeks. During the last 10 days of his stay in Bangladesh, his fever became persistent, with peaks of 40 °C (104 °F). He had reduced oral intake and constipation, but no vomiting. His mother reported that she had developed self-limited vomiting and diarrhea for a few days after the onset of his symptoms. The family denied eating street food or drinking tap water in Bangladesh. There was no history of contact with patients with tuberculosis. The child had been born in Australia to Bangladeshi parents, and his immunizations were up to date, according to the Australian schedule. He did not receive any travel vaccines prior to travel or malaria prophylaxis. His medical history was unremarkable apart from mild asthma.In the emergency department he appeared unwell and moderately dehydrated. He was febrile at 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), tachycardic with a heart rate of 160 beats per minute, and his respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute. There was no icterus, pallor, or lymphadenopathy. A skin examination did not reveal any rash, petechiae, or bruising. A chest and cardiovascular examination revealed no abnormalities. His abdomen was soft, mildly tender, and distended with no organomegaly. There was no clinical ascites and his bowel sounds were present. He was alert and oriented, with a normal neurological examination. He had no bone or joint pains or swelling. Initial investigations showed anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. His hemoglobin concentration was 102 g/L and reached a nadir of 89 g/L on day 11 of admission. He had a nadir white cell count of 4.30 × 109/L (neutrophils 2.6 × 109/L and lymphocytes 0.9 × 109/L) on presentation, which gradually improved to 11 × 109/L by day 11. His initial platelet count was 97 × 109/L. His renal function was normal apart from mild hyponatremia, while his liver function tests showed hypoalbuminemia and mild transaminitis with normal bilirubin concentrations. His C-reactive protein level was elevated at 92 mg/L. Considering his clinical presentation, travel history, and the initial investigation results, the differential diagnoses included typhoid fever, malaria, and dengue fever. We ordered a blood culture, and thick and thin blood films for malaria parasites and dengue IgM, IgG, and NS1 antigen. He was then commenced on ceftriaxone intravenously and admitted to our hospital. There were no malaria parasites seen in two films and dengue serology was also negative. The following day his stool and blood cultures grew Salmonella Typhi. The organism was reported to be susceptible to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. It was reported to be resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim.Our patient continued to have fever spikes to 39–40 °C every 4 hours after admission until the fifth day, when the frequency of fever decreased to three spikes daily. Further improvement was noticed by day 9, with temperature spikes decreasing to twice daily and less than 39 °C. He required intravenous fluids for a short period to correct his dehydration until his oral intake gradually normalized over the first week in hospital. In addition, he received an albumin infusion on day 5 after he developed clinical ascites with a further drop in his albumin to 17 g/L. Thrombocytopenia was notable in our patient. His platelet count initially fell steadily and reached a nadir of 16 × 109/L on day 5 despite appropriate antibiotic therapy (Fig. 1). He was monitored closely for complications associated with thrombocytopenia: his sensorium remained intact and he did not develop petechiae, bruising, or rectal bleeding during admission. There was no sign of intestinal perforation, with normal bowel sounds and an absence of bloody stool. At this stage, we considered whether additional therapy for thrombocytopenia would be required, such as platelet transfusion. Upon discussion with our infectious diseases team, it was decided to treat him conservatively with close observation and not to give him a transfusion. His platelet count was monitored on a daily basis, began to improve on day 6 of admission, and finally normalized on day 11 and then climbed to supra-normal levels by day 15. Likewise, his transaminases were abnormal throughout admission, peaking on day 5 (Fig. 1), but started to improve before discharge. By day 9 of admission, his oral intake improved and oral azithromycin was added to transition to oral therapy. He completed a 12-day course of ceftriaxone in hospital and was discharged in a good condition, although he still had occasional fever spikes to 39 °C. He continued to have intermittent elevated temperatures (<38 °C) at home, but his parents reported that he returned to his previous energy level and activity. After he completed a total 7-day course of azithromycin, he was reviewed in an outpatient clinic where he was afebrile with a normal examination.                                      Fig. 1                      Progress of thrombocytopenia and transaminitis over timeDISCUSSION: Typhoid or “enteric” fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi and occasionally Salmonella Paratyphi. It is characterized by severe systemic illness, often presenting with features of fever, constipation, and abdominal pain. Its incidence in endemic countries can be as high as 540 cases per 100,000 population, making it a public health challenge [1]. In an Australian setting, it particularly affects returned travelers from the Asian subcontinent [2].Important differential diagnoses of typhoid fever in a returned traveler from South and Southeast Asia include dengue fever and malaria. In addition, acute murine typhus can have similar presentation to typhoid fever. It is common, yet underdiagnosed, in travelers from this region. Thompson et al. [3] found serologic evidence of acute murine typhus in 17% of patients who presented with undifferentiated febrile illnesses at a tertiary referral hospital in Nepal. All patients had sterile blood cultures with no cases of murine typhus found among those with confirmed enteric fever [3]. We did not investigate our patient for murine typhus or other rickettsial infection because typhoid fever was confirmed promptly on day 2 of his admission.Thrombocytopenia is an important finding in the assessment of returned febrile travelers. It is defined as a platelet count below the lower limit of normal (i.e., <150 × 109/L). It is further subdivided into mild (100–150 × 109/L), moderate (50–99 × 109/L), and severe thrombocytopenia (<50 × 109/L). In a study conducted in an outpatient clinic in Germany, 3.8% of returned travelers had thrombocytopenia [4]. Typhoid/paratyphoid fever was responsible for 14% of the cases, ranking fifth after malaria, acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, dengue fever, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis. The most frequent travel destination in the study was Asia (42%) [4]. Thrombocytopenia is well reported in patients with typhoid fever. Malik [1] reported an incidence of 26% in Malaysian children with typhoid fever and Pohan [5] found it in 61.5% of cases in one study of adults. Despite this, the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia and its clinical course in typhoid fever are not well understood. Proposed mechanisms of the hematological manifestations of typhoid fever, including thrombocytopenia, include bone marrow suppression, peripheral destruction by the reticuloendothelial system, autoimmune-induced destruction, and Salmonella endotoxin-induced thrombocytopenia [5, 6]. Bone marrow examination was not performed in our patient but we note he had abnormalities in three hematological cell lines, suggesting possible bone marrow suppression.Factors that might contribute to the severity of typhoid fever include the duration of illness before therapy, the inoculum size, the immune status of the patient, and the previous vaccination against typhoid fever [7]. Our patient had been unwell for several weeks before presentation and thus the inoculum size at the time of commencing treatment could have been relatively high. He had no known or suspected immunodeficiency, but had not received a typhoid vaccination prior to travel to Bangladesh, which could have prevented this illness. The duration of illness and fever in patients with typhoid strains resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim can be more prolonged despite receiving antibiotics to which strains are susceptible [8]. Salmonella Typhi haplotype H58 predominates in many parts of Southeast Asia and is responsible for most multidrug resistance [9]. We did not perform genetic typing for our isolate, but its resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim, with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, suggests it may have been this haplotype.In addition to splenomegaly and leukopenia, thrombocytopenia is considered a sign of severe disease in typhoid fever with a higher risk for development of complications. Thrombocytopenia usually develops during the course of the illness, but it can be a presenting feature of typhoid fever, as in this case. Severe complications of typhoid include intestinal perforation, intracranial hemorrhage, and multi-organ failure [6, 7]. Among 102 children with typhoid fever in one study, 33% developed complications, most commonly anicteric hepatitis and bone marrow suppression, but also paralytic ileus, myocarditis, psychosis, cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, peritonitis, and pneumonia. The rate of any complications among those with thrombocytopenia was 54% [1]. Our patient had anicteric hepatitis, hypoalbuminemia with ascites, and thrombocytopenia, but he remained alert and oriented without any clinical evidence of intracranial hemorrhage despite a platelet nadir of 16 × 109/L on day 5 of admission. He also did not have any clinical evidence of intestinal perforation and his renal function remained normal throughout his admission. Considering our patient’s pancytopenia, we considered the possibility of infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome as a complication of his typhoid fever, because this has been previously reported [10]. Given that he was slowly improving clinically, we decided to observe him closely without performing additional invasive tests, such as bone marrow examination. Further investigation, including consideration of hemophagocytic syndrome, would have been required if he had failed to improve.Because the risk of hemorrhage is increased when the platelet count falls below 20 × 109/L, this level was traditionally considered the threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion. Later prospective studies have proved that lowering this trigger to 10 × 109/L in stable patients with cancer or blood disorders is still safe. However, platelet count should not be the only indicator for deciding transfusions. Other important elements that indicate the patient is at increased risk of bleeding, and thus likely to have an increased need for platelet transfusion, include raised body temperature, sepsis, and rapid decrease in platelet count. Like most blood products, platelet transfusions are not free of adverse effects. These include blood-borne infections, although now rare owing to good screening, bacterial contamination, febrile transfusion reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and anaphylactic reactions [11].There are no studies or guidelines addressing the management of thrombocytopenia in typhoid fever. This poses a challenge for clinicians, especially when faced with severe thrombocytopenia, as in this case. Some case reports have described platelet normalization shortly after starting antibiotic therapy without a need for platelet transfusion [12, 13]. In one case, however, the platelet count fell from 154 × 109/L to 14 × 109/L despite antibiotic therapy, and this was associated with multi-organ failure, plasma exchange was given to correct the thrombocytopenia and other abnormalities [7]. One adult patient died from severe hemolytic uremic syndrome attributed to Salmonella Typhi, with failure to respond to a platelet transfusion given along with a blood transfusion and plasmapheresis [14]. Our patient had a relatively slow recovery with fever and hepatitis persisting for 2 weeks, despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, and a slow return to normalization of platelet count on day 11. However, he avoided a platelet transfusion and was well at last follow-up.CONCLUSION:We have described a case of severe thrombocytopenia in typhoid fever with slow clinical and laboratory response but complete recovery after appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care alone, thus avoiding the risks associated with platelet transfusions or plasmapheresis. The optimal management of thrombocytopenia in typhoid fever merits further study to guide clinical practice.;

Capsule perforation and subsequent fistulation after resection and electrovaporization is seldom reported in the literature.CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a 79-year-old caucasian man with capsule perforation after transurethral prostate resection and electrovaporization resulting in a severe and recurrent symphysitis and subsequent pelvic ring fracture. The bladder-symphysis fistulation was surgically removed and additional orthopedic surgery could be avoided after definitely solving the urological problem.CONCLUSION: Urologists should be aware of rare complications after transurethral resection and electrovaporization of the prostate.;INTRODUCTION: As recently analyzed by Gilfrich and colleagues on the basis of over 95,000 cases, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) represents the most common surgical treatment approach for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in Germany [1]. Yet, the proportion of its use has decreased during recent years because of the increasing use of laser technique-based procedures [1]. Side effects and complications of TURP are repeatedly reported in the literature. Perioperative complications associated with TURP are known to differ depending on the usage of monopolar or bipolar techniques [2].Bleeding, consecutive blood transfusions, and transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome are the most relevant intraoperative complications [3–5]. Complications of the short-term and midterm follow-up are urethral stricture [6], bladder neck obstruction, or recurrent adenoma [7]. Perforation of the capsule of the prostate has been described rarely [8]. However, those perforations have seldom led to significant long-term complications.In this case report we describe a patient with recurrent symphysitis culminating in pelvic ring fracture as a midterm complication following hyperextended prostate and capsule resection and electrovaporization with symphysis erosion as a very rare and not yet reported complication of transurethral surgical cure of benign prostate hyperplasia.CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old white man (born in 1937) presented for the first time at our urology department in June 2016. He had several relevant comorbidities: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infrarenal aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, status post-sigma resection due to acute diverticulitis in 2011, obesity, peripheral vascular disease stage IIa, arteriosclerosis with occlusion of left external iliac artery, several allergies to antibiotics, arterial hypertension, left heart insufficiency, and hyperlipidemia.He was initially admitted due to acute suprapubic pain on the basis of an acute symphysitis. He had several previous urologic surgeries which are displayed in chronological order in Table 1.Table 1                      Surgical interventions related to the current medical problem in patient’s medical records                    NrDateIndicationProcedureFindingsComplicationsComments110/2011Subvesical obstructionTUR-prostate(performed in external institution)Resection of 29 g benign prostate adenoma tissueNoneOperation time: 45 min Sufficient functional results in the short-term follow-up.

Endoscopic evaluation did then show an excessively resected prostate capsule and an erosion of the ventral part of the capsule. Resection in this area revealed osseous structure which was histologically confirmed (Fig. 2). His postoperative recovery was slow. In August 2016 an inguinal/periscrotal abscess formation had to be treated surgically. This abscess was most probably related to the persisting fistulation resulting from the previous surgeries.                                      Fig. 1                      Fistulation between urinary bladder and fluid collection of the symphysis (arrows)                                                                                  Fig. 2                      Microscopic impression of resected specimen during surgery (Number 3 of Table 1). a represents bone, b represents connective tissue, probably originating from the prostate capsule or residual adenomaAs his mobility steadily decreased and he had massive pelvic pain in the following weeks, a ring fracture of the pelvis, most probably on the basis of the destabilizing recurrent symphysitis, was diagnosed radiologically (Figs. 3 and 4).                                      Fig. 3                      Symphysitis (computed tomography scan, left) and dilatation of the symphysis fissure and osseous erosions (conventional radiography, right) (arrows)                                                                                  Fig. 4                      Fracture of the right iliac crest and pelvic ring fracture (computed tomography scan) (arrows)In October 2016 we explored his suprapubic region surgically. The fistulation was detected in the transition zone from bladder neck and prostate capsule as expected. In order to definitely cure the fistulation of the prostate capsule and symphysis we performed a total fistula excision and coverage with bladder flap. In the postoperative course he recovered quickly and was discharged 12 days after the surgery. He is regularly seen and conservatively treated in our orthopedic department and he did not have to undergo further surgeries.DISCUSSION: Over the last decades TURP has been the primary method to relieve bladder outlet obstruction for patients with benign disease. The procedure has been improved over the years resulting in significant decreases of mortality and morbidity. A gland larger than 45 g, an operative time longer than 90 minutes, and surgery after acute urinary retention are seen as risk factors for increased postoperative morbidity [9]. In a large-scale prospective multicenter evaluation in Germany comprising 44 mostly non-academic urological departments, Reich and colleagues confirmed that morbidity and mortality rates of TURP were closely related to the resection weight [4]. The patient in this case had a primary resection weight of 29 g, thus a considerably small value. However, nothing is known about the learning curve position of both the primary and the secondary surgeon. In addition, his second transurethral procedure, 5 years later in February 2016 revealed a residual adenoma of an additional 18 g (transrectal ultrasound), which was located predominantly in the apical region. Analyzing over 20,000 men from Austria, Madersbacher and co-workers reported a secondary surgical procedure after initial TURP necessary due to functional insufficiency of 5.8%, 12.3%, and 14.7% at 1, 5, and 8 years of follow-up, respectively [10]. This is in compliance with the case reported here. In fact, the risk of perioperative complications increases with the number of surgeries.There is a high index of suspicion that the compromising damage to the capsule was produced during the secondary surgery because the patient’s pain increased and signs of symphysitis occurred after this second procedure.Transurethral vaporization of the prostate (TUVP) as performed in this patient has been investigated in vitro by Reich et al. [11]. They reported a 15 to 20 times higher energy demand to be considered when applying the vaporization technique in order to achieve comparable results to conventional TURP. In addition, the authors found a remarkable decline in tissue removal of more than 50% for TUVP on pretreated tissue, which can only be compensated in vivo by an additional energy input. Compared to standard TURP, pure electrovaporization as done in this particular patient requires slower speed, higher voltage, and increased pressure application [11]. In this case, the second surgery in February 2016 was of 55 minutes’ duration, which was 10 minutes longer than the initial TURP in 2011. Thus, a high energy level over a considerably longer surgical time on a preoperated prostate can be assumed and is very likely the reason for the capsule destruction. Combination of monopolar resection and vaporization may have further increased the risk of wall rupture. Since TUVP took place in another institution no data were available regarding the respective energy settings, although those settings, if extended, might represent an additional negative factor.Pubic symphysitis has been reported as a rare complication after TURP by Ziesel et al. who found 12 cases among 12,118 patients having undergone TURP over 15 years [12]. The authors could not find a single cause for developing symphysitis but remarked an overrepresentation of suprapubic trocar placement, chronic prostatic inflammation, and extended resection. In addition, they concluded that inflammatory, thermic, and/or surgical damage of the capsule were likely to be causative which is in accordance with the case reported here.All of the above-mentioned factors combined may easily explain how the capsule perforation occurred in this patient and led to the described subsequent complications.In the subsequent follow-up it took several months to finally detect the cause of the symphysitis, fistula development, and resulting pelvic instability and ring fracture. The definitive diagnosis was completed by another endoscopic procedure. The surgical treatment approach led to definitive fistula resection and is experimental in nature.The performed patient-tailored innovative surgical approach led to significantly decreased pain and improved the quality of life (QoL) of the patient. The pelvic ring fracture could be treated conservatively in the short-term follow-up of 6 months.CONCLUSION:This is to the best of our knowledge the first case of a symphysitis after capsule perforation during transurethral ablative surgeries leading to instability of the complete pelvis. Urologists need to be aware of this rare complication after transurethral procedures.;

Here, we reported the case of a woman co-infected by influenza A H7N9 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, whose treatment process was a little bit longer and a little bit complicated as well.CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was an 80-year-old Chinese woman who presented with fever, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. A computed tomography scan showed obvious infiltrations at lower parts of both lungs. Arterial blood gas analysis confirmed a severe respiratory failure (type I). Her sputum and throat swabs were checked for nucleic acid of influenza A and the result was positive for influenza A H7N9. She was diagnosed as having severe influenza A H7N9 and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was admitted to an intensive care unit. She was given comprehensive treatment, including oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, gastric protection, and noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Her condition improved 4 days later. However, some symptoms exacerbated again 2 days later with ground-glass changes appearing in upper area of right lung and the titer of antibody to Mycoplasma pneumoniae rising from 1:80 to 1:640. She was reasonably considered to be infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well, and azithromycin and moxifloxacin were added to her treatment. Oseltamivir was discontinued because of three consecutive negative results of nucleic acid for influenza A H7N9, but anti-Mycoplasma treatment was continued. Although her symptoms and abnormal changes on computed tomography scan slowly went away, she finally recovered from the mixed infection after a total of 33 days of management.CONCLUSION: In patients with confirmed influenza A H7N9 infection whose condition worsens again, especially with new infiltration or lung ground-glass infiltration, one should suspect infection by other pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae.;INTRODUCTION: Since the case of human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 was first reported in 2013 in China [1], many more cases of this disease have emerged in this country [2, 3]. Human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 is a kind of acute respiratory disease which is caused by avian influenza A H7N9 virus, with more than 90% of the infected patients presenting with rapidly progressive pneumonia and 70% of them presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mortality is as high as 30% [4].Patients with influenza A H7N9 often have some underlying diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart diseases [3], which make patients prone to infection by some other pathogens, such as bacteria. However, concurrence of influenza A H7N9 virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection has never been described.MP pneumonia is an atypical community-acquired pneumonia, which is most often mild and moderate, and its prognosis is usually good [5]. Here, we report a case with comorbidities of influenza A H7N9 and MP pneumonia, which made our patient’s treatment process a little bit longer.Our patient is an 80-year-old retired worker, whose onset started with a fever, cough, abdominal distention, weakness, and anorexia. Then, chest tightness and short of breath followed. A computed tomography (CT) scan and arterial blood gas analysis confirmed the diagnosis of severe pneumonia and a respiratory failure (type I) for our patient. She was diagnosed with influenza A H7N9 by positive result of nucleic acid for influenza A H7N9 from sputum and throat swabs 10 days later and was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) in Second Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Kaili City, Guizhou Province, China. During her treatment process, she was confirmed to have an infection of MP.Since this is the first report of influenza A H7N9 complicated with MP, and the anti-MP treatment in such cases might be different from that in MP infection alone, it is valuable to present our case report, sharing our experiences in this patient’s treatment. The main clinical characteristics of our patient and her treatment practice are reported below.CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old Chinese woman began to have fever, cough, abdominal distention, weakness, and anorexia on January 5, 2017. She had been to the local poultry market with her husband to buy a live chicken and had eaten chicken meat on January 2, 2017. She is a retired teacher, and she has three children, all of whom are healthy. She is optimistic and has healthy social relations. She currently lives with her husband. She went to see a doctor at a hospital in the southeast state of Guizhou Province on January 11, 2017. An examination showed a fever with body temperature of 38.3 °C, blood pressure of 130/78 mmHg, and pulse rate of 85 beats per minute (bpm). She was oriented and cooperative and in fine general condition. Her mental status was conscious and her neurological examination was normal. She does not smoke tobacco and does not consume alcohol. Her sputum and throat swabs were collected to test the nucleic acid of avian influenza A virus. Then, she was given some general anti-virus drugs. Fever persisted and she felt short of breath, so she went to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University on January 13, 2017. An examination revealed a highest body temperature of 39.5 °C, pulse rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 to 28 breaths per minute, moist rales located at middle-lower fields of both lungs, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% (oxygenation at 4 L/minute of oxygen with a nasal catheter), noninvasive blood pressure of 112/64 mmHg, white blood cell count of 3.46 × 109/L (neutrophils, 69.4%, lymphocytes, 0.8 × 109/L), oxygen arterial tension (PaO2) of 58.4 mmHg with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 0.41), and carbon dioxide arterial tension (PaCO2) of 31.8 mmHg. A CT scan showed obvious infiltrates in both lungs and some ground-glass opacity in the middle field of her right lung (Fig. 1a). In her past medical history, she had hypertension and COPD. Because of suspicion for contagious disease, she was admitted to the Department of Infectious Disease of our hospital and given antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and oseltamivir. On January 14, 2017, she was definitely diagnosed as having influenza A H7N9 by the positive results of nucleic acid testing and was separated from other patients. She was transferred to the ICU on the same day because of obvious dyspnea and shortness of breath. Her immediate examination on ICU admission showed oxygen pulse saturation of 65%, a body temperature of 38.5 °C, noninvasive blood pressure of 128/75 mmHg, a maximal respiratory rate of 30 to 35 breaths per minute, and she was conscious and cooperative. Her neurological examination was completely normal. Arterial blood gas result revealed a PH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2 of 49.1 mmHg (FiO2 0.41), and bicarbonate (HCO3−) of 22.8 mmol/l, biochemical results consisted of total protein of 57.38 g/l, proalbumin of 69 mg/l, potassium of 3.39 mmol/l, sodium of 129.36 mmol/l, creative kinase of 162.15 U/l, creative kinase–myocardial band (MB) of 8 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase of 420 U/l, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 185 ng/l, and procalcitonin (PCT) of 0.056 μg/L. The titer of antibody to MP was 1:80. Liver and renal functions were almost normal. Urine analysis showed red blood cell of 8 cells/low-power field (LP) and white cell of 10 cells/LP.                                      Fig. 1                      Evolution of lung imaging. a Ground-glass opacity in the upper field of the right lung and obvious consolidation and exudates in lower parts of both lungs. b Consolidation in low fields of both lungs decreased after 13 days of oseltamivir administration, but ground-glass opacity in upper area enlarged. c Ground-glass opacity of the upper area of the right lung alleviated with anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia therapyThe main diagnoses at ICU admission were severe pneumonia and ARDS.After being delivered to the ICU, our patient was given comprehensive treatments, including antibiotics, intravenously administered methylprednisolone (120 mg/day), immunoglobulin (10 g/day), and gastric protection. Oseltamivir at 300 mg/day was orally administered for the first 6 days, then at 150 mg/day for the following 3 days. As she was conscious and very cooperative, she was given noninvasive mechanical ventilation (PHILIPS Respironics V60, Respironics California, Inc, USA). Her input of fluid volume was strictly limited and her hemodynamics were stable except for occasional slight fluctuations. After having been treated for 4 days, her respiratory symptoms began to alleviate, and oxygenation improved with PaO2 up to 66 mmHg (FiO2 0.4), and respiratory rate decreasing to 24 to 28 breaths per minute. However, 2 days later, she began to cough with less sputum, and tachypnea and weakness were exacerbated. The titer of MP antibodies gradually increased from 1:80 to 1:160, and then arrived at 1:640 within 9 days. A CT scan on January 26, 2017 revealed an enlarged ground-glass infiltrate in the upper area of her right lung (Fig. 1b). She was reasonably considered to be over-infected with MP, and then orally administered azithromycin (0.5 g/day) and intravenously administered moxifloxacin (400 mg/day) were prescribed on January 23, 2017. At the same time, oseltamivir was discontinued because of three consecutive negative results of nucleic acid for influenza A H7N9. After 5 to 6 days of anti-MP treatment, her symptoms alleviated and the titer of the antibodies decreased. A gradual reabsorption of ground-glass infiltrates was seen in upper lobe of her right lung after 9 days of treatment against MP (Fig. 1c). She was discharged on February 5, 2017 with mild cough and shortness of breath on exercises.Considering that she still had a mild cough and felt somewhat short of breath, especially on exercises, and because some infiltrates in both lungs remained, she was advised to continue taking azithromycin regularly after discharge. We kept a close follow-up on her treatment. On February 7, 2017, the titer of MP antibodies decreased to 1:80. On February 13, 2017, all her symptoms had disappeared after a continuous 22 days of treatment against MP. The follow-up at 6 months after her discharge from ICU revealed that she has kept very fit. Her clinical course is summarized in Table 1.Table 1                      Main clinical process of the first case co-infected by avian influenza A H7N9 and mycoplasma pneumoniae in Kaili, Guizhou province, China                    CourseDateClinical major eventsday 15 January, 2017Fever, cough, abdominal distention, weakness, anorexiaday 711 January, 2017Went to see doctor, and sputum and throat swabs were collected to be checked for the presence of avian influenza virusday 913 January, 2017Admitted to Second Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, CT scan showed obvious consolidation and infiltration in bilateral lungs and ground-glass changes in upper area of right lung, and she was diagnosed with pneumoniae, Oseltamivir and meropenem were administeredday 1014 January, 2017Result of neucleic acid testing for H7N9 was positive and the patient was transferred to ICU because of illness deterioration and ARDS.

In her treatment process, she was confirmed to be over-infected by MP, which has not been reported before. The anti-MP process in this patient was longer than usual because of her poor underlying condition.Until now, human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 has been merely confirmed to be associated with exposure to poultry [6]. This was the case for our patient, who had been to a poultry market and had eaten chicken prior to the onset of illness. Surprisingly, her husband, who went to the market with her and had closer contact with the live poultry, remained healthy. This may be associated with his relatively perfect immune system and with no obvious underlying diseases. By contrast, his wife suffered from some underlying illnesses including hypertension and COPD, which made her more susceptible to infection from other pathogens such as avian influenza A H7N9 virus.Clinical studies have demonstrated that a proportion of patients with influenza A or B are simultaneously infected by other pathogens such as bacteria and aspergilla [3, 7, 8] because of some risk factors such as COPD, use of steroids, and diabetes mellitus or even with a immunocompetent status [8]. But as far as we know, the clinical condition of co-infection caused by influenza A H7N9 and MP has not been described before. Although “atypical” pneumonia was recognized in the 1930s, MP was actually isolated from the sputum of a patient with “atypical” pneumonia in 1944 [9]. Early clinical observations indicated a relatively high prevalence of MP respiratory infection in younger children, especially among school-aged children from 5 to 15 years of age [10]. So far, there have been fewer reports of MP respiratory infection in older individuals.Lung infection caused by MP can be diagnosed with culture of respiratory specimens and/or a fourfold rise in antibody titer to MP within 2 weeks [11]. In our patient, the MP antibody titer rose fourfold within 9 days, along with the exacerbation of some symptoms and appearance of some new ground-glass lung infiltrates. This supported our diagnosis of MP in this patient [11]. Since the incubation period of MP infection is often as long as 1 to 3 weeks [5], we speculate that MP may have already existed in our patient’s respiratory system at the time when she was infected with avian influenza A H7N9.Although MP infections are generally mild, patients may develop severe and fulminant disease at any age [12]. This is especially the case in patients who simultaneously suffer from another disease such as avian influenza A H7N9, as observed in our patient.The lack of a cell wall makes MP resistant to cell wall synthesis inhibitors such as β-lactam antibiotics. Effective drugs against MP include macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones [13]. Our patient was given azithromycin and moxifloxacin, and the ultimate result indicates that this therapeutic regimen was fortunately efficacious. It is generally recommended that the duration of treatment with azithromycin for community-acquired MP pneumonia is 7 to 14 days [14]. For our patient, azithromycin administration persisted for 22 days because of her poor underlying condition and her immunocompromised status.It is noteworthy that although no fluoroquinolone resistance has been described so far in MP clinical isolates, more and more macrolide-resistant MP have been reported in recent years [14, 15]. If the clinical manifestations do not resolve in 72 hours with macrolides administration, it is recommended to change antibiotics to tetracycline (doxycycline and minocycline) or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and levofloxacin) [15].CONCLUSION:In cases of confirmed influenza A H7N9, if the condition of the patient is not under initial treatment or if it even worsens with new ground-glass lung infiltrates, infection with another pathogen including MP must be suspected and sought.;

It has an incidence of less than 10 cases per year in Germany and mostly affects several previously healthy people at the same time. The only specific treatment is the administration of botulism antitoxin. According to the German guidelines administration of antitoxin is recommended only in the first 24 hours after oral ingestion of the toxin.CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old white woman and her 51-year-old white husband presented with paralysis of multiple cranial nerves and rapidly descending paralysis approximately 72 hours after ingestion of home-canned beans. The disease was complicated by autonomic changes like hypertension, febrile temperatures, and a paralytic ileus. The diagnosis was confirmed by identification of botulinum neurotoxin type A in the serum of the woman. In accordance with the German guidelines, antitoxin was not given due to the prolonged time interval at diagnosis. Both patients had a long intensive care unit course requiring ventilation for approximately 5 months. Finally they recovered completely.CONCLUSION: A full recovery from foodborne botulism is possible even in patients with intensive care lasting several months. There are only case reports indicating that administration of antitoxin may shorten the course of the disease, even if given later than 24 hours after intoxication. Due to the rarity of the disease and its rapid course there are no randomized controlled trials. Thus, evidence of the superiority of this treatment is lacking. However, the prevailing view according to the German guidelines to administer antitoxin only within 24 hours after ingestion of the toxin should be questioned in the case of progression of the disease with proof of remaining toxin in the blood.;INTRODUCTION: The incidence of botulism is less than 10 cases per year in Germany [1] and approximately 113 cases in the EU per year from 2008 to 2012 [2]. Of all forms of botulism including infant, wound, and adult intestinal toxemia botulism, foodborne botulism is the most frequent in Germany [1]. The diagnosis of foodborne botulism is made on high suspicion based on clinical findings of cranial nerve palsies and descending paralysis and a history of ingestion of food with low acid content in an anaerobic milieu, most commonly home-canned vegetables or meat. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) in patients’ stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces, in blood in the hyperacute stage, or in the ingested food [3]. The ingested toxin can be demonstrated in serum or feces in 40 to 44% of cases within 3 days of toxin ingestion, and in 15 to 23% of cases in specimens obtained after 3 days [4].After ingestion, BoNT, a preformed neurotoxin by Clostridium botulinum, binds to receptors in the presynaptic cell membrane. It crosses the membrane through endocytosis and acts as protease to the synaptic fusion complex. Therefore, the release of vesicles containing acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is inhibited [4], followed by failure of neuromuscular transmission causing paralysis and autonomic disturbances. Improvement of muscle strength is caused by two factors. First, there is a sprouting of axonal collaterals from the presynaptic nerve endings at the neuromuscular junctions, which have the ability to form functional synapses. Second, later, synaptic activity returns to the original nerve terminals, and the sprouts are eliminated [5].Therapy consists of supportive care and, if required, intensive care including long-term ventilation. A full recovery is possible, but the disease can have a long and exhausting course, and patients may experience and die from complications of intensive care medicine. The only specific therapy is the administration of botulism antitoxin. Trivalent (Anti-BoNT A, B, and E), equine-derived antitoxin, is available and neutralizes BoNT [3]. According to the guidelines in Germany, antitoxin should be given only within the first 24 hours after ingestion of the toxin [6]. This recommendation is based on a report of patients with wound botulism [7]. However, a retrospective analysis of 132 patients treated between 1973 and 1980 revealed that patients who received antitoxin later than 24 hours after onset of symptoms spent fewer days in hospital, fewer days on a ventilator, and fewer days to sustained improvement, than those who were not treated with antitoxin [8].CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old white woman presented to an outside hospital with subacute and progressive dizziness, diplopia, dysarthria, and bilateral ptosis, which started 8 hours prior to admission. Cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed normal results. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal. Her neurological symptoms worsened rapidly including a complete bilateral ptosis with inability to open her eyes, descending quadriparesis, and paralysis of her respiratory musculature. Approximately 24 hours following admission she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Her husband presented with similar signs and symptoms a day later. Botulism was suspected, especially when the son remembered that his parents had eaten home-canned beans of unknown age 2 days prior to the admission of his mother. The son was present at dinner but refused to eat the beans because of an odd odor.A mouse bioassay test with her serum revealed the presence of botulinum toxin A. Botulism antitoxin was not administered because more than 72 hours had passed since the ingestion of the probably poisoned beans. A tracheotomy was performed on hospital day 7, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed on day 8. In addition, she developed gastrointestinal tract paralysis as well as anxiety. Both improved with symptomatic treatment. On hospital day 27 she was transferred to an acute rehabilitation hospital with complete paralysis of all cranial nerves and persisting quadriparesis: strength 2 to 3/5 Medical Research Council (MRC). She was alert and able to respond to questions with hand waving and writing. Finally, she was weaned from mechanical ventilation after 5.5 months and discharged from the rehabilitation hospital after 11 months. The neurological signs caused by botulism had completely resolved. However, she still felt weak and remained with a depressive adaptive disorder.A 51-year-old white man, the husband of case 1, presented to an outside hospital with nausea, dizziness, progressive dysarthria, and diplopia which had started the day prior to admission. After transfer to our neurointensive care unit he showed bilateral ptosis, ophthalmoparesis with diplopia in all directions, dysarthria, dysphagia with disturbance of the oral and pharyngeal phase, and moderate bilateral facial nerve paralysis. He had full strength in his extremities and was able to walk normally. He had consumed a smaller portion of the home-canned green beans 3 days prior to admission.Botulism antitoxin was not administered because of the prolonged time interval from ingestion of the presumed poisoned beans of more than 72 hours (Table 1). The remainder of the home-canned beans was found in the couple’s home and contained BoNT A. A mouse bioassay test with his serum was equivocal because only 50% of the mice developed symptoms of botulism. Neurological decline with progressing dysarthria, dysphagia, mydriasis, ophthalmoparesis, facial nerve paralysis, tongue paralysis, and development of a quadriparesis was observed within the next 3 days. A trial of neostigmine on hospital day 3 did not result in improvement. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation on the same day for respiratory distress due to vomiting and an inability to clear secretions. Electrophysiological studies (including blink reflex and repetitive nerve stimulation, 3 Hz, of the facial nerve) on hospital day 5 were normal. The hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia, delirium with a cycle of agitation and impaired level of consciousness, and uncontrollable hypertension unresponsive to intravenously administered antihypertensives and sedatives as well as central fever (no evidence of infection was found). He underwent tracheotomy on hospital day 7. He was transferred to an acute rehabilitation hospital on day 15 with mild quadriparesis (strength 4/5 MRC) and unchanged bilateral ptosis, mydriasis, ophthalmoparesis, bilateral facial paralysis, and tongue paralysis. While in acute rehabilitation, his quadriparesis worsened (strength 3/5 MRC) and a PEG was placed. Subsequently, recovery of strength started cranially and spread caudally. He was weaned from ventilation 4.5 months after ingestion of the toxin and was discharged home after 8 months without any neurological deficit, but with complaints of generalized weakness and muscle pain. At that time he reported complete amnesia and paranoid thoughts for the first 3 months of his hospital stay.Table 1                        Selected periods of Cases 1 and 2 in the disease course                       Ingestion of toxin to symptom onset, hoursSymptom onset to resp. failure, hoursIngestion of toxin to resp. failure, hoursDuration of intubation, daysPatient 1 (female, age 47 years)303666~165Patient 2 (male, age 51 years)4882130~135                      resp. respiratoryDISCUSSION: A 47-year-old white woman presented to an outside hospital with subacute and progressive dizziness, diplopia, dysarthria, and bilateral ptosis, which started 8 hours prior to admission.

From a microbiological point of view, descending necrotizing mediastinitis is sustained by Gram-positive bacteria (43–62%), anaerobes (46–78%), and, rarely, Gram-negative bacteria. Data collected during the Antibiotic Resistance-Istituto Superiore di Sanità project confirmed that Italy is positioned among the countries with the highest levels of resistance in most pathogenic species under surveillance. In particular, 32.9% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were resistant to carbapenem, 33.6% of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 28.7% and 43.9% of Escherichia coli isolates to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, respectively.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 38-year-old white man with septic shock due to descending necrotizing mediastinitis sustained by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria treated after surgery with an IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation and polymyxin B hemoperfusion therapy.CONCLUSION: Despite the contrasting data on the use of immunoglobulins and polymyxin B hemoperfusion in septic shock and the lack of literature in cases of acute mediastinitis caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria, we obtained an improvement in clinical conditions and the survival of our patient, against all odds.;INTRODUCTION: Acute mediastinitis (AM), because of its high mortality rate, is one of the most dangerous forms of infection in the human organism. It is a severe acute inflammation of the connective tissues located in the middle thoracic cavity. Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM) represents 20% of cases of AM [1, 2]. DNM is a common and progressive polymicrobial infection involving the neck and chest and it is associated with a high death rate (10 to 40%).There are no guidelines or published articles with high level of evidence (above level III) on the treatment of DNM. Currently, the best evidence is available from four meta-analyses [3–6] of published case series of DNM, covering the period from 1960 to 2008, and a review of cervical necrotizing fasciitis and DNM [7]. The primary treatment of DNM is surgical eradication of the pharyngeal or odontogenic focus and a concomitant extensive drainage of the neck and the mediastinum. The thoracic surgical treatment could be a median sternotomy, or standard right posterolateral thoracotomy, or anterolateral thoracotomy, or subxiphoid approach, or clamshell incision, or video-assisted mediastinoscopy (VAM) drainage, and/or video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) drainage. Unfortunately, the literature did not offer a consensus on the optimal treatment modalities [6]. Surely, the surgical treatment has to be combined with an intravenously administered wide-spectrum antibiotic therapy and other intensive care treatment. From a microbiological point of view, DMD is sustained by Gram-positive bacteria (43–62%), anaerobes (46–78%), and, rarely, Gram-negative bacteria.We describe a case of AM caused by an odontogenic infection due to methicillin-resistant Enterococcus raffinosus, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) unresponsive to conventional surgical and medical therapy complicated with high levels of procalcitonin (PCT), endotoxin, and septic shock.CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old white man, 100 kg weight, with a diagnosis of DNM, was transferred to the intensive care of University of Campania “L. Vanvitelli” because of the necessity of a chest surgery-dedicated intensive care unit (ICU). He came from an ICU of a peripheral hospital with the incorrect diagnosis of pneumonia, based on a chest X-ray. He was treated with tazobactam (2 g/day)/piperacillin (16 g/day) and meropenem (6 g/day) for approximately 10 days and percutaneous tracheostomy. When he arrived at our ICU he presented respiratory failure with the necessity of mechanical ventilation with partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) < 90. He was in septic shock with severe hypotension with necessity of norepinephrine > 0.3 μg/kg per minute. His mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 50 mmHg, heart rate 130 beats per minute (bpm), and body temperature 40 °C.His medical history was: amoxycillin (2 g/day) had been used to treat his severe toothache for 2 weeks and then he presented to the emergency room of a peripheral hospital with dyspnea. He was obese (body mass index > 39) but was not affected by any other comorbidities. He was single and he worked as a truck driver. He did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol and he did not have any other risk factor for mediastinitis.All his skin was pallid except for the left side of his neck. He had a large warm mass on the left side of his neck, which extended from his mouth to his left supraclavicular region. At thoracic auscultation there were no lung sounds at the left side and some wheezes at the right side. He also presented peripheral edema. A neurological examination was not done because he was deeply sedated (Ramsay Sedation Scale 6 and Glasgow Coma Scale 3). Chest and neck computed tomography with contrast medium showed: a wide abscess in left parotid-masseter region that extended from the floor of his mouth up to the ipsilateral inferior parapharyngeal compartment, this lesion appeared to be liquefied with areas of air pockets, severe bilateral pleural effusion, and an abscess in his anterior mediastinum that extended from median to left paramedian area (Figs. 1 and 2). He immediately underwent bilateral thoracotomy and left cervicotomy with abscess drainage and left superior and inferior third molars (2.8 and 3.8 tooth), whose dental roots were necrotic, and then he was admitted to our ICU because of septic shock: qSequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) 3, SOFA score 12. All cultural examinations were done (chest drain samples, blood cultures, bronchial aspirate culture, and urine sample), in particular, the blood sample culture (VersaTREK REDOX® 1 and 2) revealed the presence of methicillin-resistant Enterococcus raffinosus, CRAB, and CR-Kp. In addition, the culture from the abscess drainage also revealed CRAB and CR-Kp. The cultures were identified with standard methods (we did not have rapid test) and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility test. The stains of pus collected were both Gram positive and Gram negative. The blood samples also revealed: white blood cells (WBC) 17,500/mL (neutrophils 85%, lymphocytes 8%), red blood cell (RBC) 2.79 × 106/ml, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dl, hematocrit 22.8%, platelet 118 × 103/ml, C-reactive protein (CRP) 12.3 mg/L (normal range 0–10 mg/L), PCT 12 ng/mL (normal 0.15 ng/mL), endotoxin activity assay (EAA) 0.72 (EAA in the low range < 0.4) with a negative predictive value of 95.1% from risk of culture-proven Gram-negative infection, aspartate transaminase 21 U/L, alanine transaminase 24 U/L, total bilirubin 0.46 mg/dl, unconjugated bilirubin 0.11 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 0.35 mg/dl, serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dl, urea 53 mg/dl, and body temperature 40 °C. Hemodynamic parameters monitored with Vigileo (specific monitor that analyzes arterial blood pressure waveform and its changes) were: cardiac output (CO) 2.1 L/minute (normal range 4.0–8.0 L/minute), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) 400 dynes · second/cm5 (normal range 800–1200 dynes · second/cm5), MAP 50 mmHg (with dobutamine 8 μg/kg per minute and norepinephrine 0.3 μg/kg per minute), and urinary output > 0.5 mL/kg per hour with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) scale 1. The blood gases showed PaO2/FiO2 171 and lactate 2.5 mMol/L (normal range up to 1.9 mMol/L). He started an antibiotic therapy with: linezolid 1200 mg/day, colistin 9,000,000 UI/day, rifampicin 600 mg/day, and tigecycline 100 mg/day. At 36 hours after the surgical and antibiotics therapy we did not notice a significant improvement so we decided to start a combined therapy with 250 ml/kg per day IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation for 3 consecutive days, together with direct hemoperfusion therapy with immobilized polymyxin B cartridges for 2 hours a day for 2 consecutive days (blood flow 100 ml/minute). Toraymyxin (PMX 20-R, Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan) is a selective blood endotoxin removal cartridge. PMX 20-R is a cartridge composed of polymyxin B covalently bonded to polystyrene-derivative fibers. Blood flow direction is well controlled by adopting a radial flow system. PMX 20-R treatment occurs by hemoperfusion at a blood flow rate of approximately 80–120 mL/minute. Heparin is preferably used as an anticoagulant. Pentaglobin (IgM-enriched immunoglobulin, Biotest) is a plasma-derived solution with the sequent composition: 12% IgM – 76% IgG – 12% IgA. Several mechanisms of action have been postulated for Pentaglobin: direct activity of antibodies, neutralization of endotoxin, enhanced clearance of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and reduction of classical complement pathway. Approximately 3 days after the beginning of this multimodal intensive and progressive treatment, gradual improvements in hemodynamics (MAP 85 mmHg without norepinephrine, CO 5.2 L/minute, urinary output > 0.5 ml/kg per hour), blood gases, and inflammatory markers (CRP 2.3 mg/dl, PCT 1 ng/ml, EAA < 0.6, body temperature 36.5 °C, and lactate 0.3 mMol/L) were achieved (Table 1). We noted a fluid overload of our patient during the first 36 hours before starting the therapy with Toraymyxin and Pentaglobin but there was a rapid and immediate recovery of a normal urine output after the beginning of that therapy, following on from increasing MAP.

Approximately 3 weeks after his admission to ICU, he was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. His ICU course was complicated also by polyneuropathy, myopathy, and hyperthyroidism. Finally, after 5 weeks, he was transferred to a rehabilitation institute. He was discharged home 3 weeks later (Fig. 3). At 6 months follow-up he was discharged to home without tracheostomy and was starting to work again.                                      Fig. 3                      Case report timeline. ICU intensive care unitDISCUSSION: In this case report we describe a rare case of DNM due to Gram-negative and Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria. We obtained the resolution of DNM by assembling conventional surgical therapy and a novel treatment with IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation and direct hemoperfusion therapy with immobilized polymyxin B cartridges, even though there was no recommendation for this treatment in this case and there was a lack of literature.AM is a severe, life-threatening infection of the mediastinal connective tissues, interpleural spaces, and surrounding thoracic organs. DNM is a rare complication of odontogenic infection [8] arising generally from the second or third molar. Other less common infections include acute tonsillitis, and retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscess. This abscess can rupture into the submandibular and parapharyngeal spaces and reach the mediastinum mainly along the retropharyngeal space or along the perivascular and pretracheal spaces [9, 10]. The effect of gravity and the negative intrathoracic and pleural pressure during inspiration, and the absence of barriers in the facial planes are important pathophysiological factors in the extension of deep neck infections of the mediastinum [10]. In a systematic review published in April 2016 by Prado-Callero et al., the authors analyzed 26 studies with a total of 480 patients. DNM was reported to be limited to the upper mediastinum in 189 patients (39%) and extended to the inferior mediastinum in 249 patients (51%) [1]. The origin of DNM was pharyngeal (acute tonsillitis, retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscess) in 204 patients (45%), odontogenic abscess in 163 patients (36%), from other causes in 83 patients (18%), and not reported in 30 patients [1].In addition the presence of coexisting morbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), alcoholism, tobacco smoking, chronic renal failure, and liver cirrhosis, can facilitate this rapid extension and increase the occurrence of complications including bilateral empyema, purulent pericarditis, AKI requiring hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and septic shock. Endo et al. [11] classified DNM according to the anatomic extent: type I infection above the carina (localized form), and type II infection below the tracheal bifurcation (diffuse form), which is subdivided into type IIA (lower anterior mediastinum) and type IIB (lower posterior mediastinum).The mortality under current “standard treatment” is reported to be between 20 and 40% [12, 13] mostly as a consequence of multiorgan failure (MOF).The etiological organisms of DNM are mostly mixed, aerobic and anaerobic [5, 14]. Although the main microorganisms implicated are Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. staphylococci), Gram-negative pathogens can also be a relevant cause of DNM [15].A European network of national surveillance systems on antimicrobial resistance (EARS-Net), coordinated and financed by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), has been created to collect data from 29 European countries to analyze temporal and spatial trends of the phenomenon. European data confirm an increase in resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides especially in Escherichia coli and in K. pneumoniae, responsible for urinary tract infections, sepsis, and other health care-related infections. These resistances are often combined, generating multi-resistant bacteria. In recent years, resistance to carbapenem has appeared, making some infections untreatable. Data collected during the Antibiotic Resistance-Istituto Superiore di Sanità (AR-ISS) project have confirmed that Italy is among the countries with the highest levels of resistance in most pathogenic species under surveillance, namely 32.9% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to carbapenem, 33.6% of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 28.7% and 43.9% of E. coli isolates to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, respectively [16].Compared with other microorganisms, DNM associated with Gram-negative pathogens has higher rates of in-hospital death [16]. Invasive infections associated with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) pose a serious challenge to clinicians. CRAB has increasingly emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen [17, 18], and the postoperative mediastinitis caused by CRAB is rare. It has severe complications associated with high morbidity and mortality. Treatments with polymyxin (polymyxin b or colistin), carbapenem, or their combinations are basically supported by observational studies [19, 20].The significance of interplay between immune system-related substances and bacterial toxins in the pathogenesis of sepsis and the subsequent deleterious effects on organ function is well known. Apparently, endotoxins/LPS and lipoteichoic acid are the key toxins produced by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively, playing an important role in inducing a systemic inflammatory response [21, 22] and it was found that removing them from circulation can have beneficial effects. Polymyxin B is a well-known antibiotic with high affinity for endotoxin and it is able to neutralize it, although it is associated with neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, which precludes its systemic use. In 1994, the Japanese company Toray (Tokyo, Japan) designed Toraymyxin (PMX-20R device) in order to adsorb and neutralize endotoxins from the circulation by using polymyxin B in extracorporeal modality, fixing it covalently on polystyrene fiber matrix. It has been shown in meta-analyses and many experimental studies [24, 25] that extracorporeal endotoxin adsorption using this method is beneficial in the management of patients with sepsis [23], especially in managing the septic shock and in the reversal of organ dysfunction. Some researchers [24, 25] reported that selective removal of endotoxins/LPS can specifically improve hemodynamic and respiratory functions, and this was explored in a systematic review by Cruz et al. [26] concluding that it is associated with an improved MAP, inotrope use, levels of PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and decreased mortality.Several studies reported improvement in SVR [27–31], CO, or cardiac index [29, 31]. However, pooled data seem to indicate that polymyxin B hemoperfusion should be able to increase blood pressure with the reduction of vasoactive agents [29, 32–35] compared with conventional treatments [36, 37]. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion might improve the oxygenation index and oxygenating lung functions [33, 34] possibly because of a reduction in pulmonary epithelium injury, permeability, and endothelial damage. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion improves gas exchange (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), but there was only a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) that reported this outcome and it showed only a non-significant positive trend [37]. After polymyxin B hemoperfusion, reduced levels of other mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-6 [38, 39], IL-10 [38, 39], IL-18 [40], tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α [39, 41], metalloproteinase-9 [27], plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [39, 41], neutrophil elastase [42, 43], platelet factor-4 [40], β-thromboglobulin [40], soluble P selectin [40], and endogenous cannabinoids, were also observed [44].However, there are currently no recommendations supporting (nor against) the routine use of blood purification techniques in sepsis in International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock [45]. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated a favorable effect on overall mortality with this technique [46]. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution because of the suboptimal quality of studies. The other treatment used in these patients was IgM-enriched polyclonal immunoglobulin (IVIgGM). Immunoglobulins constitute an innovative product with a wide range of clinical use.In the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign, there is a weak recommendation with low quality of evidence concerning the use of immunoglobulins [45]. One larger multicenter RCT [47] in adult patients found no benefit for intravenously administered immunoglobulin (IVIg). The Cochrane meta-analysis [48] differentiates between standard polyclonal intravenously administered immunoglobulins (IVIgG) and IVIgGM. In ten studies with IVIgG, mortality between 28 and 180 days was 29.6% in the IVIgG group and 36.5% in the placebo-group, and for the seven studies with IVIgGM, mortality between 28 and 60 days was 24.7% in the IVIgGM group and 37.5% in the placebo-group. The certainty of the studies was rated as low for the IVIgG trials, based on the risk of bias and heterogeneity, and as moderate for the IVIgGM trials, based on risk of bias. However, the recent Cochrane analysis revealed no survival benefits. These findings are similar to those of an older meta-analysis [49] from other Cochrane authors. One systematic review [50] showed a reduction in death with immunoglobulin treatment, however, the results of only high quality trials did not show a statistically significant difference. Finally, Laupland et al. [49] found a significant reduction in mortality with the use of IVIg treatment.Recently, two meta-analyses, using less strict criteria to identify sources of bias found significant improvement in patient mortality with IVIg treatment [51, 52]. Finally, there are no cut-offs for plasma IVIg levels in patients with sepsis, for which substitution with IVIg improves outcome data [52]. Subgroup effects between IgM-enriched and non-enriched formulations reveal significant heterogeneity. The low certainty of evidence led to the grading as a weak recommendation. The statistical information that comes from the high quality trials does not support a beneficial effect of polyclonal IVIg.CONCLUSION:In our case we decided to start the treatment with immunoglobulins and polymyxin B hemoperfusion after the failure of conventional surgical and medical therapy and in light of elevated endotoxin level. This case of DNM was difficult to treat because of the presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria probably related to the delay in diagnosis and the use of first-line antibiotics for treatment of incorrectly assumed pneumonia. After the surgical source control, only with the combined use of IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation and polymyxin B hemoperfusion as integration antibiotic therapy, did we obtain an improvement of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. CO, cardiac index, SVRs, central venous saturation of oxygen (ScVO2), and oxygen delivery (DO2I) improved. PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved, endotoxemia and PCT decreased, and vasoactive agents were interrupted. Despite the contrasting data on the use of immunoglobulins and polymyxin B hemoperfusion in septic shock and AM caused by either Gram-negative or Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria, we obtained an improvement of clinical conditions and the survival of our patient against all odds.;

One obstacle to immune checkpoint inhibitor use is the higher incidence of immune-mediated side effects that can prompt discontinuation of therapy. Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema has been described with immune checkpoint inhibitors only once previously. We report a case of a patient who developed remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema related to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and stress that these symptoms can be managed without cessation of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 70-year-old white man who presented with 4 months of progressive inflammatory arthritis with pitting edema. He had been started on nivolumab therapy for his metastatic melanoma with excellent response prior to symptom onset. The symptoms started in his knees and subsequently involved both hands and feet. On evaluation, he was wheelchair bound and completely dependent for all activities of daily living. Evaluation revealed negative serological testing and plain film imaging. Ultrasound demonstrated diffuse flexor tenosynovitis and soft tissue swelling, and a diagnosis of remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema was made. He was treated with orally administered corticosteroids (0.5 mg/kg per day) which improved his symptoms significantly and allowed him to regain prior independent functioning. His corticosteroids were tapered (0.15 mg/kg per day) but not discontinued and his nivolumab treatment was not interrupted. In follow up he continued to have stable control of his melanoma as well as his remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema.CONCLUSION: In conclusion we present the first case of nivolumab-induced remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema that is controlled by maintenance low-dose orally administered corticosteroids allowing for continuation of nivolumab therapy. Clinicians who encounter mild-to-moderate immune checkpoint inhibitor immune-mediated adverse effects can consider maintaining immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with concomitant low-dose corticosteroids rather than abrupt cessation of the immune checkpoint inhibitor.;INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors can be used in the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and small cell lung cancer. Often, they are used as salvage therapy. Nivolumab is a monoclonal IgG4 antibody that targets T-lymphocyte programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) receptors and thereby disrupts regulation and promotes immune activation and anti-tumor response. Other checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4). As a byproduct of immune activation, a spectrum of immune-related adverse effects including vitiligo, Sweet’s syndrome, mucositis, lymphocytic rash, non-infectious colitis, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, Guillain–Barré syndrome, fulminant myocarditis, inflammatory arthritis, sicca syndrome, and uveitis have been extensively reported [1–12].Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) is a rare inflammatory arthritis characterized by acute onset symmetric distal tenosynovitis and pitting edema of hands and feet. It is usually responsive to low-dose glucocorticoids and occurs more often in older individuals with a male predominance [13]. Inflammatory markers may be elevated, but rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) antibodies are usually negative [14]. MRI and ultrasound findings reveal extensor tenosynovitis with lesser amounts of flexor tenosynovitis, joint synovitis, and subcutaneous tissue thickening [15]. RS3PE is a relatively poorly characterized syndrome that has been associated with malignancies, medications, and autoimmune disease. A review of the literature reveals a single previously reported case of nivolumab causing RS3PE [16]. In that case, nivolumab was held for resolution of the RS3PE and eventually discontinued due to malignancy progression. It is unclear if holding nivolumab contributed to malignancy progression or whether RS3PE would have progressed with continued nivolumab.CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old white man developed right knee pain and swelling followed by left ankle pain and swelling over a week. Over the next 4 months, his symptoms progressed to include both knees, both feet, and both hands. Due to the severity of his symptoms he was unable to ambulate or carry out normal activities of daily living. He initially took ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily with some mild improvement, but at the time of presentation, it offered no relief.In addition, he endorsed morning stiffness that persisted for most of the day. Due to the stiffness in his joints, he could no longer ambulate and presented to our clinic in a wheelchair. He previously was fully functional and independent in his activities of daily living. He was an avid fisherman and was unable to pursue his interests at all.His past medical history was significant for metastatic melanoma initially diagnosed 2 years ago. His initial lesion was located over the left side of his neck and he had a Mohs procedure with negative margins. He was monitored closely for 1.5 years until he was found to have new right lower lobe lung nodules on positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. Wedge resection of the right lower lobe revealed metastatic melanoma with wild type BRAF and no C-KIT mutations. Continued surveillance demonstrated an increasing number of right pulmonary nodules over the next 6 months. Dual therapy nivolumab (1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses followed by 240 mg every 2 weeks) and ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) immunotherapy was started. After the second cycle of his immunotherapy he developed severe non-infectious colitis requiring hospitalization. His immunotherapy was stopped and his colitis resolved with supportive care and glucocorticoids. Without further immunotherapy, he developed new left pulmonary nodules within 6 months that were increasing in size. Single agent immunotherapy with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) was started 4 months before his presentation to Rheumatology. With single agent immunotherapy, the pulmonary nodules receded fully and no further metastatic disease was seen on subsequent PET/CT imaging 3 months later.His medical history was also notable for hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy.He was treated with hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and nivolumab. He had no known drug allergies.There was no family history of connective tissue disease or inflammatory arthritis. His mother died from colon cancer in her 80s and his father had coronary artery disease. He was married with three living children. He served in the Navy during the Vietnam War and worked as a mechanic after his military service until retirement. He denied any history of recreational drug or alcohol use. He reported a 20-pack year tobacco smoking history, but quit over 10 years ago.He denied having any chest pain, shortness of breath, rashes, oral or nasal ulcers, alopecia, Raynaud’s disease, fevers, chills, night sweats, or unintended weight loss. He did endorse feeling weak because of his chronic condition.He appeared his stated age and in no apparent distress. His temperature was 37 °C, blood pressure 116/78, heart rate 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on ambient air. His musculoskeletal examination was significant for tender boggy synovitis of his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPs), proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPs), wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPs). There was no palpable effusion in any joint but he had significant soft tissue pitting edema present over his extremities. There was +3 pitting edema over the dorsum of both hands and feet extending up to his wrists and mid-shins respectively. There was mild erythema and warmth present over his joints, most notable over his MCPs (Fig. 1). There was decreased range of motion in his hands, feet, ankles, elbows, and knees. There also were extensor tendon rubs noted on range of motion of his MCPs bilaterally by palpation and auscultation. The remainder of the musculoskeletal examination and general physical examination was unremarkable. There were no rheumatoid nodules noted on examination.                                          Fig. 1                        Soft tissue swelling and pitting edema of the hand and footResults of the laboratory evaluation are shown in Table 1. Our patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP) were quite elevated. The remainder of his laboratory tests was unremarkable. Ultrasound and X-ray imaging of his hands were obtained (Figs. 2 and 3) demonstrating soft tissue swelling and extensor tenosynovitis. There were no erosions present.Table 1                        Laboratory values                      Laboratory testInitial visitNormal valuesWBC count, × 109/liter3.84.0–11.0Hemoglobin, gm/dl12.211.5–15.7Platelets, × 109/liter233150–400AST, units/liter4210–47ALT, units/liter367–45LDH, units/liter12588–192ESR, mm/hour1190–20CRP level, mg/dl113< 5.0Ferritin, ng/ml67225–345TSH, mIU/L1.730.4–5.0Hepatitis C antibodyNegativeNegativeHepatitis B surface antigenNegativeNegativeHepatitis B core antibodyNegativeNegativeAntinuclear antibodiesNegative< 1:40Rheumatoid factorNegative< 12CCPNegative< 20                      ALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, CCP cyclic citrullinated peptides, CRP C-reactive protein ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone, WBC white blood cell                                                              Fig. 2                        Longitudinal and transverse views of an extensor tendon of the wrist demonstrating tenovitis and tendinopathy (arrows)                                                                Fig. 3                        Plain films of both handsHe was started on prednisone 40 mg (0.5 mg/kg per day) and tapered gradually over the course of 6 weeks to 10 mg daily. He had a very rapid response to the prednisone with almost complete resolution of his symptoms. Once his prednisone was decreased below 10 mg he began noticing a steady return of his symptoms. During this time period he continued treatment with nivolumab and on surveillance imaging he had complete resolution of metastatic disease. Due to the marked response of his melanoma to immunotherapy, it was felt that paraneoplastic RS3PE was unlikely. Although at the time there were no published reports of nivolumab or other checkpoint inhibitors causing a RS3PE picture, it was felt that because of the temporal relationship between the nivolumab and the acute onset of his symptoms that they were related. The numerous previously described autoimmune conditions associated with checkpoint inhibitors raised the possibility that this presentation of RS3PE was another rheumatological manifestation. The clinical dilemma we were left with was that our patient had previously demonstrated a very rapid relapse of his stage 4 melanoma when off treatment, yet was incapacitated with the side effect of the treatment. After a careful discussion with his oncologist, we elected to maintain a steady dose of prednisone of 7.5 mg daily to control rheumatological symptoms and continue nivolumab. At 9 months, he demonstrated minimal pitting edema, no inflammatory arthritis, and continued full response from nivolumab therapy.DISCUSSION: His past medical history was significant for metastatic melanoma initially diagnosed 2 years ago. His initial lesion was located over the left side of his neck and he had a Mohs procedure with negative margins. He was monitored closely for 1.5 years until he was found to have new right lower lobe lung nodules on positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. Wedge resection of the right lower lobe revealed metastatic melanoma with wild type BRAF and no C-KIT mutations. Continued surveillance demonstrated an increasing number of right pulmonary nodules over the next 6 months. Dual therapy nivolumab (1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses followed by 240 mg every 2 weeks) and ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) immunotherapy was started.

Its main complication is damage of coronary arteries, which has the potential to be fatal. Here we report a rare case of Kawasaki disease that occurred in a 20-year-old Greek adult.CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old Greek man presented with high fever, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting, headache and significant malaise. He had an erythema of the palms and strikingly red lips and conjunctiva. As he did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics and after having excluded other possible diagnoses, the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease was set. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and oral aspirin on the 10th day since the onset of the illness. His clinico-laboratory response was excellent and no coronary artery aneurysms were detected in coronary artery computed tomography performed 1 month later.CONCLUSION: This report of an adult case of European Kawasaki disease may be of benefit to physicians of various specialties, including primary care doctors, hospital internists, intensivists and cardiologists. It demonstrates that a case of prolonged fever, unresponsive to antibiotics, in the absence of other diagnoses may be an incident of Kawasaki disease. It is worth stressing that such a diagnosis should be considered, even if the patient is adult and not of Asian lineage.;INTRODUCTION: Kawasaki disease (KD), also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is an acute necrotising vasculitis of the medium- and small-sized vessels. It was first described by Tomisaki Kawasaki in 1967. It occurs most often in babies and children, aged 6 months to 5 years and the male-to-female ratio ranges from 1.5–1.8 to 1. KD is most prevalent in Japan, while Korea holds the second place as to the number of patients. Its incidence in Japanese and Korean children living in the USA and following a Western lifestyle is higher than in Caucasian children. Since the disease is not common in adults, especially in Europe, it is very often misdiagnosed [1-4]. According to a review in 2011, 91 cases of adult KD had been described until that time [5]. Eight more cases have been added to the medical literature since then [6-13]. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the 100th one. It is the first described adult Kawasaki case not only in Greece, but also in South-Eastern Europe (Figure 1).                                      Figure 1                      A global map of reported adult Kawasaki disease cases, including the present one. The size of the circles is proportional to the number of published cases in each country, ranging from 1 to 36.The pathogenesis of KD is to a very large extent unknown. A passive protection by maternal antibodies could possibly explain the rarity of the illness during the first months of life of an individual. An infectious cause might be possible, since seasonal outbreaks, national epidemics, associations with tropospheric wind patterns [14] and a self-limited course of the disease have been observed [15]. Some studies point out that the trigger for KD could be a bacterial superantigen [2,3] or a fungal toxin [16]. The immune character is suggested by B and T cells activation and cytokines production. Moreover, the severity of KD symptoms has been correlated with the expression of THRIL, a long noncoding ribonucleic acid involved in tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α regulation [17]. Also of interest, a murine model of KD develops a similar coronary arteritis after a single intraperitoneal injection of group B Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract [18].A genetic predisposition hypothesis is supported by: i) noticeable differences in incidence rates among people of various ethnic groups along with ii) a higher incidence of KD among siblings of a patient compared to the general population. Nevertheless, the genetic background of KD remains mostly unclear. A series of polymorphisms in a number of genes have been linked with increased susceptibility for KD, with the most notable ones being in ITPKC [19] and CASP3 [20]. Finally, the genetic loci of FCGR2A, HLA, BLK and CD40 have also been suggested as susceptibility candidates by means of genome-wide association studies [21-23].KD diagnosis is absolutely clinical since no specific diagnostic tests are available [5], although the proteins meprin A and filamin C were recently shown to possess potential as KD biomarkers [24]. The diagnosis is possible if an individual has persistent fever for more than 5 days, is unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, has no proof of infection and four out of the five following criteria: i) polymorphous rash, ii) conjunctivitis, iii) cervical lymphadenopathy, iv) oral changes including injected pharynx or lips, cracked or fissured lips, strawberry tongue, v) extremity changes starting with oedema or erythema and then progressing to desquamation of feet and hands, starting periungually [1,2,12,15]. Unfortunately, these diagnostic criteria are valid for the diagnosis of KD in children, but have not yet been validated in adults [5].Coronary artery damage is the main and sometimes fatal complication of the disease, being expressed as aneurysm, calcification or stenosis [25,26]. Coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) can change with time: they may regress, stay unchanged, progress to obstruction and, rarely, rupture or expand [3]. If coronary abnormalities are present, the diagnosis of KD can be set even when less than four of the aforementioned criteria are met [5,27]. Susceptibility to coronary artery lesions formation has been associated in various populations with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in a wide range of genes, such as ITPKC [19], IL-10 [28], TGFBR2 [29], DC-SIGN [30] and KCNN2 [31]. Arteries other than the coronary ones are also affected by the disease: a hepatic artery aneurysm [32], a left humeral artery aneurysm, with absence of flow in the antebrachial arteries causing a peripheral gangrene [33], a proximal gastroduodenal artery occlusion, and a mildly irregular splenic artery associated with obstruction of the distal intrasplenic branches [34] are described in the literature.Systemic inflammation of many organs can occur. Inflammation of the central nervous system would cause typical meningitis [35] or just headache [2,8,32,36-43]. As to the myocardium and pericardium, KD may be the cause of tricuspid regurgitation with vegetations [44], mitral valve regurgitation with thickened mitral leaflets [45], pericardial effusion [45], myocarditis [12,36] or heart failure [12,46,47].Clinical and laboratory findings concerning liver inflammation are jaundice [32,40,48,49], hepatomegaly [15,32,50], right upper quadrant pain [32,39], cholestatic hepatitis [6,44,46-49,51], hepatic artery aneurysm [32], elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels [2,8,11,13,33,34,40,41,43,52,53] and low albumin levels [11,40,53].Mild renal failure, dysuria [6], as well as sterile leucocytosis in urine analysis [11,15] can be manifestations of renal involvement in KD.The upper and lower respiratory system may also be affected. Reddened pharynx [35,38-43,47-49,54], sore throat [2,36,39,41,43,44,51,55-58], rhinorrhoea [43], mild non-productive cough [39,43,44], dyspnoea [46], laboured respirations [32,48], rales [47], and acute respiratory distress [47] are symptoms often encountered.The upper and lower intestinal tract are involved in KD as well. Nausea [2,6,32,37,39,41,43,48,49,55,56,58], vomiting [6,35,37,39-41,43,44,55], stomach cramps [48], epigastric pain [47,49], dysphagia [34,40,51], abdominal pain [39,40,51,58], abdominal tenderness [49], abdominal distension [47], and diarrhoea [32,39-41,47-49] are the main symptoms and signs.The musculoskeletal system participates in the inflammatory process with various clinical representations: arthralgia of the big joints [2,34,40-43,46,48,49,51,55,58] or of the small ones [57], arthritis of the big joints [42], back pain [39], hand and foot pain [39,41], painful synovial thickening without effusion [32], joint effusion [2], joint pain with or without motion [2,44], joints tender to palpation [51], and myalgia [27,36,43,49,51,53].Lymphadenopathy is often observed in KD. It may be mainly cervical [2,6,8,10,12,13,32-34,36,37,39,40,42,44,46-52,55-58], but also axillary [33,36,40], inguinal [40,59] or diffuse [38,41,43,45,54].Skin and mucous membranes express a variety of abnormalities: skin rash [2,8,12,13,15,33-36,38-50,52-56,58], skin eruptions [12,36,41,51], polymorphic erythema [6,10], erythema of palms and soles [15,34,40-42,45,48,51,54,55], perineal erythema [12,35,36,40,52], induration and swelling of hands and feet [6,8,12,13,34,36,39-43,46,51,56,58], desquamation of palms and soles [2,10,11,13,32-35,37,38,40-47,49,57,59], strawberry [10,13,32,35-37,40,41,44-48,50-52,55,57,59], fissured [2] or coated tongue [15,48], angular stomatitis [12,35,40,44,52], mucosal ulcers [51,56], erythematous [36,42,45,50,51,57], fissured [40-42,48,49] or oedematous [8,11] lips, erythematous mucous membranes [32,38], mucositis of the urethra without discharge [41], and icterus [47,49].Eye problems are frequent and of great variety: conjunctivitis [2,8,10-13,32-34,36-52,54,55,57-59], iritis [37], keratitis [34,52], icteric sclera [32,47], painful eyes [37], palpebral oedema of the eyes [40], and reduction of vision [52]. As to the ear, tinnitus and mild bilateral hearing loss have been reported [34].Adult KD seems to occur more frequently in patients with human immunodeficiency virus [5,37-40,42,50,58]. Diseases to be differentiated from Kawasaki are viral and bacterial infections, drug hypersensitivity syndromes, toxic shock syndrome and autoimmune diseases with idiopathic juvenile arthritis being a representative example [2,5,25,27,60].Ideal treatment for KD should be immediate administration, no later than on the 10th day of the disease onset, of both immunoglobulin at 2g/kg once and aspirin at 50 to 100mg/kg for as long as the inflammation is present [6,8,39,40,45,49,52,56]. Unfortunately, diagnosis within 10 days since the disease onset is set only in very few cases [6,8,13,36,45,49,52], whereas treatment is given late in others [2,15,37,44,50,51,55-57]. In a review in 2011, only 15 out of 91 patients with KD were administered treatment with both intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin within the first 10 days of the disease onset [5]. Some patients received only aspirin [15,35,36,43,44,46-48,51,55,57], while others were treated with IVIG only [37,40,50,51].Individuals who do not respond to the dual treatment [2,3,6,12,42,61] have refractory KD and should be treated with a second dose of immunoglobulin (2g/kg) [39,42] and in non-responsiveness with high doses of corticosteroids, tapered progressively until C-reactive protein (CRP) regresses to normal levels [62]. A third [42] and fourth [34] dose of immunoglobulin have also been reported for relapses. Immunosuppressive factors, such as anti-TNF, could be a potentially beneficial treatment [3,26,27,63,64]. Treatment choices in refractory KD could also be plasmapheresis and thalidomide [42].The long-term outcome of adults with a history of KD without CAA is excellent [2,5,13,15,34,36,39,40,43,44,46-49,55,56]. Anticoagulation treatment should be discontinued after 6 to 8 weeks and a healthy lifestyle should be adopted [26]. By contrast, patients with large aneurysms (>6mm), regressed large ones or persistent small ones are at high risk for developing stenosis or ischemia. They should be put on strong anticoagulation therapy and lifelong follow-up [2,3,7,9,10,33,53,65]. These individuals have to be periodically tested with echocardiography, stress tests, computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance imaging. Catheter-based angiography, although invasive, may sometimes prove useful [5].CASE PRESENTATION: The pathogenesis of KD is to a very large extent unknown. A passive protection by maternal antibodies could possibly explain the rarity of the illness during the first months of life of an individual. An infectious cause might be possible, since seasonal outbreaks, national epidemics, associations with tropospheric wind patterns [14] and a self-limited course of the disease have been observed [15].

Moreover, the severity of KD symptoms has been correlated with the expression of THRIL, a long noncoding ribonucleic acid involved in tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α regulation [17]. Also of interest, a murine model of KD develops a similar coronary arteritis after a single intraperitoneal injection of group B Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract [18].A genetic predisposition hypothesis is supported by: i) noticeable differences in incidence rates among people of various ethnic groups along with ii) a higher incidence of KD among siblings of a patient compared to the general population. Nevertheless, the genetic background of KD remains mostly unclear. A series of polymorphisms in a number of genes have been linked with increased susceptibility for KD, with the most notable ones being in ITPKC [19] and CASP3 [20]. Finally, the genetic loci of FCGR2A, HLA, BLK and CD40 have also been suggested as susceptibility candidates by means of genome-wide association studies [21-23].DISCUSSION: KD diagnosis is absolutely clinical since no specific diagnostic tests are available [5], although the proteins meprin A and filamin C were recently shown to possess potential as KD biomarkers [24]. The diagnosis is possible if an individual has persistent fever for more than 5 days, is unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, has no proof of infection and four out of the five following criteria: i) polymorphous rash, ii) conjunctivitis, iii) cervical lymphadenopathy, iv) oral changes including injected pharynx or lips, cracked or fissured lips, strawberry tongue, v) extremity changes starting with oedema or erythema and then progressing to desquamation of feet and hands, starting periungually [1,2,12,15]. Unfortunately, these diagnostic criteria are valid for the diagnosis of KD in children, but have not yet been validated in adults [5].Coronary artery damage is the main and sometimes fatal complication of the disease, being expressed as aneurysm, calcification or stenosis [25,26]. Coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) can change with time: they may regress, stay unchanged, progress to obstruction and, rarely, rupture or expand [3]. If coronary abnormalities are present, the diagnosis of KD can be set even when less than four of the aforementioned criteria are met [5,27]. Susceptibility to coronary artery lesions formation has been associated in various populations with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in a wide range of genes, such as ITPKC [19], IL-10 [28], TGFBR2 [29], DC-SIGN [30] and KCNN2 [31]. Arteries other than the coronary ones are also affected by the disease: a hepatic artery aneurysm [32], a left humeral artery aneurysm, with absence of flow in the antebrachial arteries causing a peripheral gangrene [33], a proximal gastroduodenal artery occlusion, and a mildly irregular splenic artery associated with obstruction of the distal intrasplenic branches [34] are described in the literature.Systemic inflammation of many organs can occur. Inflammation of the central nervous system would cause typical meningitis [35] or just headache [2,8,32,36-43]. As to the myocardium and pericardium, KD may be the cause of tricuspid regurgitation with vegetations [44], mitral valve regurgitation with thickened mitral leaflets [45], pericardial effusion [45], myocarditis [12,36] or heart failure [12,46,47].Clinical and laboratory findings concerning liver inflammation are jaundice [32,40,48,49], hepatomegaly [15,32,50], right upper quadrant pain [32,39], cholestatic hepatitis [6,44,46-49,51], hepatic artery aneurysm [32], elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels [2,8,11,13,33,34,40,41,43,52,53] and low albumin levels [11,40,53].Mild renal failure, dysuria [6], as well as sterile leucocytosis in urine analysis [11,15] can be manifestations of renal involvement in KD.The upper and lower respiratory system may also be affected. Reddened pharynx [35,38-43,47-49,54], sore throat [2,36,39,41,43,44,51,55-58], rhinorrhoea [43], mild non-productive cough [39,43,44], dyspnoea [46], laboured respirations [32,48], rales [47], and acute respiratory distress [47] are symptoms often encountered.The upper and lower intestinal tract are involved in KD as well. Nausea [2,6,32,37,39,41,43,48,49,55,56,58], vomiting [6,35,37,39-41,43,44,55], stomach cramps [48], epigastric pain [47,49], dysphagia [34,40,51], abdominal pain [39,40,51,58], abdominal tenderness [49], abdominal distension [47], and diarrhoea [32,39-41,47-49] are the main symptoms and signs.The musculoskeletal system participates in the inflammatory process with various clinical representations: arthralgia of the big joints [2,34,40-43,46,48,49,51,55,58] or of the small ones [57], arthritis of the big joints [42], back pain [39], hand and foot pain [39,41], painful synovial thickening without effusion [32], joint effusion [2], joint pain with or without motion [2,44], joints tender to palpation [51], and myalgia [27,36,43,49,51,53].Lymphadenopathy is often observed in KD. It may be mainly cervical [2,6,8,10,12,13,32-34,36,37,39,40,42,44,46-52,55-58], but also axillary [33,36,40], inguinal [40,59] or diffuse [38,41,43,45,54].Skin and mucous membranes express a variety of abnormalities: skin rash [2,8,12,13,15,33-36,38-50,52-56,58], skin eruptions [12,36,41,51], polymorphic erythema [6,10], erythema of palms and soles [15,34,40-42,45,48,51,54,55], perineal erythema [12,35,36,40,52], induration and swelling of hands and feet [6,8,12,13,34,36,39-43,46,51,56,58], desquamation of palms and soles [2,10,11,13,32-35,37,38,40-47,49,57,59], strawberry [10,13,32,35-37,40,41,44-48,50-52,55,57,59], fissured [2] or coated tongue [15,48], angular stomatitis [12,35,40,44,52], mucosal ulcers [51,56], erythematous [36,42,45,50,51,57], fissured [40-42,48,49] or oedematous [8,11] lips, erythematous mucous membranes [32,38], mucositis of the urethra without discharge [41], and icterus [47,49].Eye problems are frequent and of great variety: conjunctivitis [2,8,10-13,32-34,36-52,54,55,57-59], iritis [37], keratitis [34,52], icteric sclera [32,47], painful eyes [37], palpebral oedema of the eyes [40], and reduction of vision [52]. As to the ear, tinnitus and mild bilateral hearing loss have been reported [34].Adult KD seems to occur more frequently in patients with human immunodeficiency virus [5,37-40,42,50,58]. Diseases to be differentiated from Kawasaki are viral and bacterial infections, drug hypersensitivity syndromes, toxic shock syndrome and autoimmune diseases with idiopathic juvenile arthritis being a representative example [2,5,25,27,60].CONCLUSION:Ideal treatment for KD should be immediate administration, no later than on the 10th day of the disease onset, of both immunoglobulin at 2g/kg once and aspirin at 50 to 100mg/kg for as long as the inflammation is present [6,8,39,40,45,49,52,56]. Unfortunately, diagnosis within 10 days since the disease onset is set only in very few cases [6,8,13,36,45,49,52], whereas treatment is given late in others [2,15,37,44,50,51,55-57]. In a review in 2011, only 15 out of 91 patients with KD were administered treatment with both intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin within the first 10 days of the disease onset [5]. Some patients received only aspirin [15,35,36,43,44,46-48,51,55,57], while others were treated with IVIG only [37,40,50,51].Individuals who do not respond to the dual treatment [2,3,6,12,42,61] have refractory KD and should be treated with a second dose of immunoglobulin (2g/kg) [39,42] and in non-responsiveness with high doses of corticosteroids, tapered progressively until C-reactive protein (CRP) regresses to normal levels [62]. A third [42] and fourth [34] dose of immunoglobulin have also been reported for relapses. Immunosuppressive factors, such as anti-TNF, could be a potentially beneficial treatment [3,26,27,63,64]. Treatment choices in refractory KD could also be plasmapheresis and thalidomide [42].The long-term outcome of adults with a history of KD without CAA is excellent [2,5,13,15,34,36,39,40,43,44,46-49,55,56]. Anticoagulation treatment should be discontinued after 6 to 8 weeks and a healthy lifestyle should be adopted [26]. By contrast, patients with large aneurysms (>6mm), regressed large ones or persistent small ones are at high risk for developing stenosis or ischemia. They should be put on strong anticoagulation therapy and lifelong follow-up [2,3,7,9,10,33,53,65]. These individuals have to be periodically tested with echocardiography, stress tests, computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance imaging. Catheter-based angiography, although invasive, may sometimes prove useful [5].;

The gold standard treatment for Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia is an anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) in combination with alkylating agents and dexamethasone. Treatment targeting the B-cell receptor such as ibrutinib (but not idelalisib) is currently approved for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 71-year-old white French man with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia who presented with acute renal failure and hyperviscosity syndrome. His Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia was refractory to first-line treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone. Because of his hemorrhagic syndrome and medical history of recent myocardial infarction, we decided to treat him with idelalisib 150 mg twice daily instead of ibrutinib. We observed a very quick improvement in the patient’s clinical status without need for dose adjustment.CONCLUSION: Our patient’s case provides the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, that idelalisib may be an efficient treatment option for patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia complicated by anuric renal failure and in whom ibrutinib is contraindicated.;INTRODUCTION: Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare B-cell lymphoma characterized by monoclonal proliferation of lymphoplasmacytes that produce monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM). Common complications are hyperviscosity syndrome, cytopenia, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and neurological manifestations [1]. Renal complications, such as mild proteinuria or hematuria, nephrotic syndrome, and Bence-Jones proteinuria, occur rarely. Less than 3% of patients develop end-stage renal failure [2]. Over 90% of patients with WM carry the MYD88 L265P gene mutation [3], which promotes the survival of WM cells through activation of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) pathway and promotes activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway [4]. The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib is approved in pretreated patients or as first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy. Ibrutinib has an overall response rate (ORR) of 90% [3, 5]. In a phase II study, a PI3Kδ inhibitor (idelalisib) was reported to be effective in patients with WM that is refractory to anti-CD20 and alkylating agents, with an ORR of 80% [6].In this report, we describe a patient with WM who presented with acute anuric renal failure and hyperviscosity syndrome refractory to first-line treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (RCD). Because of the patient’s age and a medical history of recent myocardial infarction (1 month before), hemorrhagic syndrome, and end-stage renal failure, we decided to treat him with idelalisib 150 mg twice daily (full dose). His initial response to this treatment was very good.Our patient’s presentation of WM and anuric acute renal failure is very rare. For these patients, dosages of chemotherapy should be carefully adjusted and are not easy to manage. We report our patient’s case to illustrate how idelalisib could be effective for treatment of this pathology and is easy to manage in patients with anuria. However, a concern needs to be raised for these very fragile patients because the use of idelalisib may often cause unclarified adverse events, such as the severe skin complication in our patient.CASE PRESENTATION: In 2016, a 71-year-old white French man presented with a 2-week history of bilateral blurry vision, recurrent epistaxis, and nausea. The patient was retired from his job (forester). His physical examination revealed that he was pale and had cardiac arrhythmia and mild basal pulmonary hypoventilation. He had no palpable hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy. The result of his neurological examination was normal (no neurological focalization, vertigo, headache, or hearing loss). His blood counts showed anemia (hemoglobin, 90 g/L) and normal leukocyte and platelet levels. His laboratory investigations showed normal liver enzymes with normal coagulation tests. We observed acute renal failure with serum creatinine 414 μmol/L (clearance, 12 ml/min according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate based on creatinine and patient characteristics [MDRD]) versus 88 μmol/L 1 month before (clearance, 75 ml/min), as well as potassium 5.1 mEq/L. His total proteins were 105 g/L with albumin 22.8 g/L and β2-microglobulin 10.73 mg/L. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation revealed IgM-kappa paraprotein (50.2 g/L). The patient had proteinuria with 1.72 g/24 h. Urine immunofixation confirmed the excretion of monoclonal kappa light chains (1 g/24 h). The result of his cryoglobulin screen was negative. A computed tomographic scan (without contrast) showed the absence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, but a rectus sheath hematoma was present, probably owing to anticoagulation for chronic fibrillation and a recent myocardial infarction.Because of the patient’s hemorrhagic syndrome, no kidney biopsy was performed. A bone marrow biopsy showed 95% interstitial infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Fig. 1a). The MYD88 (L265P) mutation was detectable with allele-specific PCR (Fig. 1b) on isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells. Bone marrow mononuclear cells presented as a CD19+, CD20+, CD23low, CD10− CD5low phenotype (Fig. 1c). Chromosomal analysis on the bone marrow sample demonstrated an abnormal karyotype with monosomy 8 (Fig. 1d). The patient’s ophthalmoscopic examination showed bilateral scattered retinal hemorrhages and venous tortuosity, with macular edema. A WM-associated nephropathy and hyperviscosity syndrome was diagnosed according to the International Prognostic Scoring System for Waldenström macroglobulinemia [7], and the patient was treated with RCD (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone and 1 week later rituximab to avoid symptomatic IgM flare) without plasmapheresis because of a favorable evolution within the first week.

Lane 4 is a no-template control. d Medullary karyotyping (QFQ). Chromosomal banding analysis of the bone marrow sample demonstrated an abnormal karyotype with monosomy 8Unfortunately, 4 weeks after beginning RCD, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for oliguria, confusion, blurred speech, and severe skin and mucosal bleeding. The result of his physical examination was similar to the one at the first admission (no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy and no neurological focalization). His funduscopic examination revealed bilateral retinal vein dilation and tortuosity, with retinal hemorrhage. His blood counts still showed anemia (hemoglobin, 100 g/L) and normal leukocyte and platelet levels. Laboratory investigations still showed normal liver enzymes with normal coagulation tests. The patient’s plasmatic creatinine increased to 769 μmol/L (clearance, 6 ml/min according to MDRD). The serum protein immunofixation assay showed prominent monoclonal bands against IgM and kappalight chain antiserum (47.3 g/L).Plasmapheresis and hemodialysis were promptly started. Because of the patient’s acute renal failure as well as an acute coronary syndrome (treated with antiplatelet agents a few weeks before this presentation), treatment with idelalisib 150 mg twice daily was started. We quickly observed an improvement in the patient’s clinical status along with the viscosity decrease. Five days after the first plasmapheresis, the patient was discharged from the ICU and hemodialysis (serum creatinine, 437 μmol/L, clearance, 12 ml/min according to MDRD). Four months later, the patient’s laboratory test results showed a good response, with serum creatinine 173 μmol/L (clearance, 34 ml/min according to MDRD), total proteins 82 g/L, and gamma-globulins 28.1% (21.5 g/L). Serum immunofixation identified monoclonal IgM-kappa (19.4 g/L). With the decreases in creatinine rate, serum monoclonal IgM level < 90%, and an absence of new complications from WM, we concluded that the patient had a partial response according to the Owen et al. criteria (Fig. 2) [8]. The response was maintained over the 4-month duration of treatment. Unfortunately, idelalisib had to be stopped because of a cutaneous complication. The patient developed a psoriasiform dermatitis, which partially improved 1 month after interrupting idelalisib. Idelalisib was restarted after dermocorticoid treatment at 100 mg twice daily, with controlled psoriasis. The patient’s evolution was unfortunately poor, with frequent hospitalizations for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia treated with ciprofloxacin or piperacillin and tazobactam.                                      Fig. 2                      Evolution of biological parameters after idelalisib treatment. a Relevant biological parameters collected from the diagnosis until 4 months after the beginning of idelalisib. b Case progress and treatment are summarized in a graph representing creatinine and plasma electrophoresis fraction. Hb Hemoglobin, IgM Immunoglobulin MEight months after his first admission, the patient was admitted to the ICU for septic shock with P. aeruginosa with extended-spectrum β-lactamase bacteremia. Unfortunately, the patient had severe hypotensive episodes during dialysis and presented seizures complicating antibiotic use (imipenem). The patient and the family clearly expressed their wish that the patient not receive invasive procedures or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He died of septic shock and iatrogenic encephalopathy attributed to carbapenem. No autopsy was done according to the wish of the family.DISCUSSION: In this case report of our patient with first-line chemotherapy-refractory WM, treatment with ibrutinib was debatable for several reasons. Ibrutinib interferes with platelet aggregation, which would promote bleeding [9]. Moreover, ibrutinib promotes atrial fibrillation and has side effects that affect the heart through an unclear mechanism. Second-line therapy with idelalisib was initiated because ibrutinib did not appear to be safe in a patient with atrial fibrillation and a recent history of acute myocardial infarction and bleeding. Considering the patient’s acute renal failure, idelalisib appeared to be a good choice. Renal excretion accounts for 15% of idelalisib’s elimination, which is eliminated mostly through a hepatic pathway. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that dose adjustments are not necessary in patients with renal dysfunction [10]. Therefore, idelalisib appeared to be easier to manage than standard chemotherapy. (Bendamustine was not used, owing to the patient’s acute renal failure).An initially good response was observed, notably improving the patient’s renal failure and proteinuria. The patient’s diuresis resumed normally. Creatinine and proteinuria kept improving 4 months later, with the best values being 173 μmol/L and 0.48 g/L, respectively. Unfortunately, the treatment had to be stopped because of major psoriasiform dermatitis, which began with pruritus with hypereosinophilia. Rash after treatment with idelalisib was described in a phase III study in which researchers evaluated the safety and efficacy of idelalisib, with 10% of patients developing a rash and 2% of patients developing a grade 3 rash [11]. Idelalisib was recognized as a trigger of psoriasis, which then evolved by itself. Because of this severe complication, treatment was interrupted in our patient, but it was not contraindicated. Idelalisib was restarted after dermocorticoid treatment at 100 mg twice daily, and the patient had controlled psoriasis.A patient with a medical history of acute renal failure, a recent ICU admission, severe dermatitis, and receiving idelalisib daily should probably be considered to have an increased risk of developing infections. Recently, Zelenetz et al. carefully observed that idelalisib was associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events [12, 13]. They described frequent febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and pyrexia in the idelalisib group. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to death occurred more often in the idelalisib group, and that group also had more infections. The evolution of our patient’s case was poor because of an infection (P. aeruginosa bacteremia) that was possibly secondary to the skin lesions and resulted in frequent hospitalizations. These outcomes serve as a reminder that frail patients receiving idelalisib must be managed very carefully.The gold standard treatment for WM is an anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) in combination with alkylating agents and dexamethasone. The development of treatments targeting the B-cell receptor pathway led to the development of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors: ibrutinib and idelalisib [14]. Ibrutinib was recently approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory WM. In the pivotal idelalisib study published in 2014, 9 (14%) of 64 patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders had lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or WM. In this cohort, only four patients achieved a complete or partial remission, with no details about whether the response was better in the tumoral syndrome (four had evaluable lymphadenopathy) or in monoclonal immunoglobulin and its hyperviscosity (five had measurable serum monoclonal IgM with symptomatic hyperviscosity or clinically relevant cytopenias). However, the MYD88 L265P mutation, found in 80–90% of patients with WM [3, 15], promotes the PI3K pathway, suggesting that idelalisib could be an effective therapy. Idelalisib represents an interesting molecule for treating WM because it is a potent inhibitor of PI3Kδ and is highly selective for the δ-isoform, which is hyperactive in B-cell cancer signaling pathways. In lymphoid cell lines and primary samples from patients, idelalisib blocked PI3Kδ-AKT signaling and promoted apoptosis.CONCLUSION:Our patient’s case provides the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, that idelalisib may be an effective treatment option for patients with WM complicated by anuric renal failure and in whom ibrutinib is contraindicated, especially those who are not eligible for intensive treatment because of advanced age, comorbidities, or poor performance status. However, our experience, as previously published [12], illustrates that careful attention needs to be paid to managing serious adverse events and infections.;

It can affect any organ system, particularly the gastrointestinal system, but there is no report of acute liver failure as a brucellosis complication.CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of acute liver failure secondary to brucellosis infection. A 75-year-old Hispanic man presented to a University Hospital in Chía, Colombia, with a complaint of 15 days of fatigue, weakness, decreased appetite, epigastric abdominal pain, jaundice, and 10 kg weight loss. On examination in an emergency room, abdomen palpation was normal with hepatosplenomegaly and the results of a liver function test were elevated. The diagnosis of brucellosis was confirmed by epidemiological contact and positive Rose Bengal agglutination with negative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoglobulin M for Brucella. He was then treated with doxycycline plus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, with a favorable clinical outcome.CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of brucellosis can be very imprecise because it can affect any organ system, however, there is no report of acute liver failure as a brucellosis complication. This is the first reported case in the Colombian literature of acute liver failure due to brucellosis. We found this case to be of interest because it could be taken into account for diagnosis in future appearances and we described adequate treatment and actions to be taken at presentation.;INTRODUCTION: Brucella species are bacteria that infect humans as an incidental host. Human brucellosis usually results from contact with fluids from infected animals (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, and rats) or by consumption of contaminated animal products such as unpasteurized milk and cheese [1]. This infection has multiple clinical manifestations and requires a specific diagnosis based on epidemiological analysis and laboratory confirmatory tests in order to initiate the appropriated antibiotic treatment. Here we present the case of a patient with brucellosis infection secondary to contact with cows from his farm infected with brucellosis. He presented with acute liver failure (ALF) which is a rare but possible complication of this zoonosis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old Hispanic man, born and resident in Zipaquirá, Cundinamarca (which is a Colombian rural area), who works as an independent seller, presented to the emergency department of the Clinic of the Universidad de La Sabana with a complaint of 15 days of fatigue, weakness, decreased appetite, epigastric abdominal pain, jaundice, and 10 kg weight loss. He had a history of peptic disease and degenerative arthritis.On examination in our emergency department his temperature was 36.5, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 103 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 92%. His skin was pale and he had mucocutaneous jaundice, icteric conjunctivae, and bleeding stigmata of mucosa in oral cavity. Abdomen palpation revealed tenderness at palpation in right and left upper quadrants and epigastric region.

The next day there was an increase in our patient’s liver function test results and his kidney test results started to elevate. He was re-interrogated by medical attendants, he told them that he had been in contact during the last 2 months with a cow who died of brucellosis, the diagnosis of the cow had been made by a specialist vet. With this background, the physician suspended the antibiotic scheme and added doxycycline 200 mg every day plus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 80/400 mg every 6 hours.A sero-agglutination test Rose Bengal was reported as positive and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin (Ig) M for Brucella was negative.The evolution after the onset of specific antibiotic treatment was favorable with evident clinical improvement of his symptoms and paraclinical tests. He could go home after 11 days of hospitalization. The discharge diagnosis was ALF secondary to brucellosis. A month later our patient was followed up with a hepatic scintigraphy, where only mild cirrhosis was reported, in addition, he was asymptomatic and without clinical signs of sequelae or reinfection.DISCUSSION: Brucella species are a Gram-negative coccobacillus, aerobic, non-spore forming, and non-motile bacteria. There are six recognized species according to their primary host preferences, that is Brucella abortus, cattle, Brucella melitensis, in sheep and goats, Brucella suis, in pigs, Brucella ovis, in sheep, Brucella canis, dogs, and Brucella neotomae, in wood desert rats, however, there is no clear basis for host preferences although there may be pseudogenes that influence host adaptation. Brucella infects humans as an incidental host after direct contact with tissues or blood from infected animals or by consumption of contaminated animal products like unpasteurized milk and cheese [1–3].The prevalence of Brucella infection in humans depends on factors such as husbandry practices, food preparation techniques, and trade of animals. There are no preferences for age and sex. The current seroprevalence rate for brucellosis in cattle in Colombia is estimated between 2.4 and 5%, especially in rural areas [4]. Infection may also result from the entry of the bacteria from infected animals through skin lesions, conjunctiva, or from inhalation [5, 6]. In the pathogenesis of Brucella, Brucella are ingested by polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages, then move to local lymph nodes to replicate intracellularly, and bacteria from lysed cells can infect other cells or disseminate systemically. During the intracellular phase, Brucella display survival strategies to suppress host’s immune response and avoid destruction, all these activities may promote the chronicity of infection [1, 7].The incubation period is approximately 1 to 4 weeks. Brucellosis is a systemic infection with a broad clinical spectrum from asymptomatic disease to severe or fatal illness. The main presentations are insidious onset of fever, arthralgia, myalgia, weight loss, and abdominal pain as well weakness, fatigue, and headache. Physical findings are variable, such as hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, although these are very unspecific findings, we correlated clinical manifestations with the epidemiologic history referred by our patient in this case. Brucellosis can develop into a chronic disease and be persistent, becoming a granulomatous disease capable of affecting any organ system [2, 8].In approximately 30% of cases, brucellosis can affect any organ system [9]:                    Genitourinary system – the most common manifestation is orchitis and epididymitis [9].                                      Hematological system – it can cause anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation [6].                                      Neurological system – it includes meningitis, encephalitis, and neuritis [10].                                      Osteoarticular system – is the most common presentation, it could involve sacroiliac joints and large joint of lower limbs [11].                                      Pulmonary system – it could cause bronchitis, interstitial pneumonitis, lobar pneumonia, pleural effusion, or empyema [12].Genitourinary system – the most common manifestation is orchitis and epididymitis [9].Hematological system – it can cause anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation [6].Neurological system – it includes meningitis, encephalitis, and neuritis [10].Osteoarticular system – is the most common presentation, it could involve sacroiliac joints and large joint of lower limbs [11].Pulmonary system – it could cause bronchitis, interstitial pneumonitis, lobar pneumonia, pleural effusion, or empyema [12].The gastrointestinal system can be compromised, a patient can present with clinical hepatitis and other manifestations such as hepatic or splenic abscess, pancreatitis, colitis, and spontaneous peritonitis, which are rare [13]. Liver involvement is frequent in acute and chronic brucellosis, as an increase in transaminase values and a mild hepatosplenomegaly can occur, sometimes an acute hepatitis develops [14]. However, ALF is a rare condition that happens in previously healthy individuals without pre-existing cirrhosis in which there is a rapid deterioration of liver function results, coagulation abnormality, usually an international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5, and any degree of mental alteration (encephalopathy), all of this was presented clinically by our patient [15].In this case report, the epidemiology and patient demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and diagnostic images, ruled out the possible presence of toxins, viral hepatitis, vascular events, and miscellaneous conditions as a possible cause of ALF, leading to the increasing diagnostic probability of the findings being attributed to brucellosis [4]. Regarding the diagnosis, there are methods to detect antibodies against cell wall components or cytoplasmic proteins of the bacteria, for example: serum agglutination, ELISA, Rose Bengal agglutination, Coombs test, Immunocapture agglutination (Brucellacapt®), and 2-mercaptoethanol agglutination [16].ELISA is the second most common serologic method after the serum agglutination test. ELISA is objective, rapid, and highly sensitive, it measures IgM, IgG, and IgA. However, there are problems with the examination, for example, quality and interpretation of results could be different in different laboratories [16, 17]. There are investigations that concluded that ELISA does not improve diagnostic accuracy compared with other techniques, and they showed that the sensitivity to IgM or IgG was lower compared to serum agglutination. Other reports described negative ELISA with multiorgan compromise [18]. This could be an explanation of the negative ELISA IgM report in this case report.Rose Bengal agglutination is a cheap, effective, and rapid slide-type agglutination serologic test performed with a stained B. abortus suspension at pH 3.6–3.7 and plain serum. Because of its simplicity, it is often used as a screening test in human brucellosis and would be optimal for small laboratories with limited means [19, 20].The standard treatment for brucellosis is to control the illness and prevent complications and relapses. The goal of disease management is based on appropriate antibiotic therapy that includes drugs that can penetrate macrophages and act in the intracellular acidic medium [21]. There are two major regimens for the treatment:1.                      Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 6 weeks, plus gentamicin 5 mg/kg daily for 5 to 14 days [21, 22].                     2.                      Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily plus rifampin 600 to 900 mg (15 mg/kg) orally once daily for 6 weeks [21].Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 6 weeks, plus gentamicin 5 mg/kg daily for 5 to 14 days [21, 22].Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily plus rifampin 600 to 900 mg (15 mg/kg) orally once daily for 6 weeks [21].For the case presented in this case report, management was associated with doxycycline + TMP/SMX, which is considered in the literature to be an optional scheme for the treatment [23–25]. Our patient had an adequate response to this management.CONCLUSION:To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the Colombian literature of ALF due to brucellosis. In addition, ALF is not a common complication of a brucellosis infection. We found this case to be of interest because it could be taken into account for diagnosis in future appearances and we described adequate treatment and actions to be taken at presentation to control the illness and prevent complications and relapses.;

It is characterized by poor prognosis and aggressive metastatic features.A literature review evidenced only 19 cases, with poor outcome.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a colonic “pure” malignant extrarenal rhabdoid tumor with metastatic nodes in a 65-year-old Caucasian man. He was treated surgically with no recurrence, no adjuvant chemotherapy, and with 4-year survival without disease at the time of the submission of this article.CONCLUSION: We present an extraordinary case of long-term survival due to the extended surgical treatment.We believe that the absence of organ metastasis at presentation is a positive prognostic factor, although pathology confirmed node involvement (13/38 positive) on microscopy.;INTRODUCTION: A malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a subtype of Wilms’ tumor, first described by Beckwith and Palmer in 1978 [1]. It is most common in children, usually with a renal localization. Adult forms are rare, and they are characterized by a poor prognosis. However, similar lesions arising in soft tissue and other sites have been reported and referred to as malignant extrarenal rhabdoid tumors (MERTs), which have been accepted as a clinical-pathological entity of their own. They share common histology and immunophenotype, and can be mixed with different types of neoplasms (carcinomas, melanomas, and sarcomas). The extrarenal variants are very aggressive, and have most often been located in the central nervous system (CNS), liver, soft tissue, and colon [2]. Presentation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is rare and the prognosis of the affected patient is poor due to the aggressive nature of this disease. MRT is characterized by early diffuse metastasis, with death generally occurring within 6 months from initial diagnosis [3].CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to Padova University Hospital for diffuse abdominal pain associated with generalized weakness, decreased oral intake, and weight loss of 20 kg in 2 months.A physical examination at admission showed pale conjunctiva and skin, bilateral auscultation revealed clear lungs, and heart auscultation did not elicit any murmurs, rubs, or gallop.An abdominal examination induced abdominal pain with rebound tenderness, bowel sounds were present in all quadrants. A right inguinal mass suggestive of lymphadenopathy was found on examination. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.Patient history revealed ischemic cardiomyopathy treated with endovascular coronary revascularization, diabetes, and depression. Diverticulosis of the colon and sigmoid polyposis were reported in a colonoscopy performed the previous year. No family history of malignancy was reported. During the recovery, our patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which was negative, and a colonoscopy, which showed an ab-extrinsic compression of the cecum.A total body computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, and it described a 10 × 8 × 10 cm mass invading the cecum and ascending colon (Fig. 1a) with lymphadenopathy. No metastasis was found. Tumor markers were negative.                                      Fig. 1                      Computed tomography scan describing a mass involving cecum and ascending colon (a) and the absence of recurrence at a 4-year follow-up (b)Our patient underwent an elective right hemicolectomy with extended lymphadenectomy in the hepatogastric and aortocaval areas, and renal fat excision. The post-operative period was uneventful and he was discharged from the surgical unit on post-operative day 6.The pathologic diagnosis was rhabdoid tumor. The tumor stage was defined as T3N2M0 (13/38 positive nodes). Immunohistochemistry revealed cells positive for vimentin (Fig. 2) and epithelial membranous antigen (EMA), and negative for CK7, CD34, CD31, CD20, CD3, CD45, C-Kit, OCT-2. Immunostaining for integrase interactor 1 (INI-1) showed loss of nuclear expression, which is consistent with MERT. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the corresponding SMARCB1 was not performed in consideration of the immunohistochemical results. Our patient did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, and he is still alive and in good clinical conditions 48 months later, without recurrence (Fig. 1b).

Case reports and center series were identified by PubMed “MeSH” search up to October 2016. Search items included: MERT, malignant rhabdoid tumor, colon rhabdoid tumor, rhabdoid colon cancer, and rhabdoid carcinomas. The cases obtained were from 19 manuscripts plus our case report, for a total of 20 patients to be analyzed.A thorough search of the literature revealed 19 cases of primary rhabdoid tumor of the colon. Table 1 shows the clinical and histological characteristics of all cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma of the colon with rhabdoid features found in the literature. This entity seems to be a disease of older people with a mean age of 68 years at presentation, only four recent articles described the disease in young patients (<50 years). No gender predilection was evident (the male/female ratio was 10/9). The average size at presentation, which we calculated based on the tumor’s longest diameter, was 8 cm. The largest tumor was 15 cm and the smallest one was 4 cm. These tumors were distributed equally along the colon. Only four patients did not have identifiable organ metastasis or positive nodes at presentation. Fourteen patients had at least one positive lymph node invasion or distant metastasis. From the 19 cases in the literature, 11 cases had mixed histologic characteristics with adenocarcinoma and rhabdoid features, whereas the remaining eight cases had “pure” rhabdoid features (Table 2).Table 1                      Literature review of colonic rhabdoid tumors                    AuthorAge/genderSiteSize (cm)TreatmentHystologyOutcomeMetastasisCTChetty, et al. 1993 [15]72 MCecum6×5×2R hemicolectomyCompositeDead (3 mo)Liver, nodes Yang, et al. 1994 [16]75 MTrasverse15×10×5R hemicolectomyPureDead (2 wk)Nodes Macak, et al. 1995 [17]50 MRectum6×5×3.5ResectionComposite                            Not reported                          Nodes Marcus, et al. 1996 [18]84 FTrasverse7ResectionCompositeAlive (12 mo)None Nakamura, et al. 1999 [19]76 MCecum14×8×6R hemicolectomyPureDead (3 mo)Liver, nodes Kono, et al. 2007 [20]66 MCecum13×13R hemicolectomyCompositeDead (6 wk)Nodes Lee, et al. 2013 [4]62 M83 FSigmoid colonRectum4×4×16.5×4.3Low anterior resectionLow anterior resectionCompositeCompositeAlive (36 mo)Dead (1 mo)NodesLiver, lung, NodesYesMoussaly, et al. 2015 [21]87 FTrasverse12×9.5×8.5R hemicolectomyCompositeDead (2 mo)None Mastoraki, et al. 2009 [22]62 FDescending colon8×10×8ResectionPureDead (4 mo)Liver Han, et al. 2010 [9]23 FRectum6×5Miles resectionPureAlive (17 mo)NoneYes + RTRemo, et al. 2012 [5]73 FRight colon10×4R hemicolectomyCompositeDead (6 mo)NodesYesPancione, et al. 2011 [6]71 FAscending colon10×10R hemicolectomyPureDead (8 mo)Liver, peritoneum nodesYesAgaimy, et al. 2014 [23]79 MCecum9×5×2R hemicolectomyPureDead (6 mo)1 regional node Romera Barba, et al. 2014 [24]77 MDescending colon-L hemicolectomyPureDead (2 mo)None Baba, et al. 2014 [25]45 F--ResectionCompositeDead (6 wk)Not reported Cho, et al. 2015 [26]73 MCecum4×x3R hemicolectomyCompositeAlive (1 mo)Nodes Kalyan, et al. 2015 [7]31 FCecum7R hemicolectomyCompositeDead (4 mo)NodesYesSamalavicius, et al. 2013 [8]49 MRectum7Total mesorectal excisionPureDead (7 mo)NodesYesD’Amico et al., present study65 MAscending colon10R hemicolectomyPureAlive (48 mo)Nodes                     CT chemotherapy, mo months, RT radiotherapy, wk week                  Table 2                      Subgroup analysis (our case was excluded)                     CasesDead/max survivalOrgan metastasis/nodes in deadCT, RT in deadAlive/max survivalOrgan metastasis/nodes in aliveCT, RT in aliveSurvival literature reviewPure87 / 7 mo50% / 83%28,5%1 / 17 mo0%, 0%100%12,5%Composite11*7 / 6 mo33% / 83%28,5%3 / 36 mo0%, 67%33,4%30%                    CT chemotherapy, mo months, RT radiotherapy                    *One patient did not have survival reported in the literature reviewAll patients underwent surgical resection as the first line of therapy. The overall survival for this tumor, even after surgical intervention, seems to be limited, with a large majority of the patients surviving less than 6 months. Only three studies described a survival of 1 year, in these patients there was no distant metastatic organ disease at the time of presentation. Six patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, five of them were N1. One patient received 12 cycles of leucovorin, flurouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and he was still alive at the time the manuscript was written, surviving 36 months without recurrence or distant metastasis [4]. Another patient received a trial of capecitabine and oxaliplatin and had a 6-month overall survival [5]. A third patient received a trial of bevacizumab and cetuximab and had an 8-month survival [6]. A fourth patient received one cycle of 5-flurouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6), palliative radiosurgery to the rib, and three cycles of epirubicin, capecitabine and oxaliplatin (EOX), but she expired within 4 months of her diagnosis [7]. Samalavicius et al. treated their patient with FOLFOX4 and leucovorin, flurouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) regimen, with a survival of 7 months [8]. Han et al. described therapy with adjuvant radiotherapy (40 Gy) and chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) [9].CONCLUSION:Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) are aggressive neoplasms that were first described in young children with renal primary neoplasms [10, 11]. MRTs were later seen to arise at different locations, such as the central nervous system (CNS) [5], liver [6], genitourinary tract [7], and GI tract [8], known with the name of extrarenal rhabdoid tumors (MERTs). The histologic hallmark of MERTs is a centrically located and large nucleus, prominent nucleoli, abundant and eosinophilic cytoplasm, and paranuclear inclusions of intermediate filaments and abundant mitotic figures. Review of the pathologic characteristics of all cases available in the literature demonstrates that centric nuclei are the common feature among all MERTs.These tumors are described as “composite” when the rhabdoid phenotype is mixed with another type of identifiable neoplasm and termed “pure” when the rhabdoid features are the only identifiable phenotype. When adenocarcinoma and rhabdoid tumor coexist, the rhabdoid features remained similar in all of them [4].The histogenesis of MERT is unclear. Ota et al. [12] suggested that the rhabdoid tumor cells were derived from a primitive pluripotent cell that had the potential for a wide range of differentiation and accounted for the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in MERTs. In the literature review, we observed that the only patient alive in the “pure” subgroup had no involvement of lymphatic nodes or organ metastasis at the time of surgery, and underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the “composite” subgroup, the patient with a longer survival had positive nodes and received chemotherapy (Table 2). This confirms the difficulty to define a prognosis based on histological findings and the absence of a standard therapeutic protocol, implying the relevance of performing an R0 resection in the first place.The management of these tumors is usually surgical resection if the tumor is operable. The rare occurrence of MERT has made it complicated to establish adequate survival-improving protocols. Most of the reports indicate that MERTs are highly aggressive tumors, with more than 75% of patients dying within 6 months of the initial diagnosis [3, 4].GI rhabdoid tumors are very rare. The majority of extrarenal rhabdoid tumors occur in children, while GI rhabdoid tumors are more common in the elderly population. Cytokeratin and vimentin are frequently found on immunochemistry.Historically, all the rhabdoid colorectal cancers reported in the literature primarily affect older people, with ages ranging from 62 to 84 years of age and with no gender preference. Nevertheless, we found a few cases in young patients in our review.Recent reviews suggested that these tumors are large and tend to be located in the transverse colon or proximal ascending colon [3, 4], however, our literature review highlighted a predominance in cecum involvement. Surgical tumor resection was adopted by all series as first-line treatment, but despite it, survival remained low with a median survival of 7 months. We noted that patients alive at the time of publication were patients without metastasis at presentation or with limited node involvement. Nevertheless, two of four patients with no macroscopic metastasis or positive nodes during the surgical intervention, expired in less than 2 months. Horazdovsky et al. concluded in their meta-analysis that surgery and actiomycin therapy may improve survival in MERT [13]. Beneficial results of adjuvant treatment have been reported for MERTs in the skin and CNS, but not in the liver. Chemotherapy did not seem to impact survival (Table 1), also, Pancione et al. [6] and Remo et al. [5] reported that adjuvant chemotherapy had no significant benefit. The role of adjuvant treatment for MERT in the gastrointestinal tract is unknown. Since extrarenal rhabdoid tumors are rare, no standard therapeutic pathway exists and no randomized trials that examine the role of chemotherapy combinations or addition of new drugs have been done. Also, the use of radiotherapy did not improve survival in adults with MRTs [14].We report an extraordinary case of a patient with long-term survival due to the extended surgical treatment. We believe that the absence of organ metastasis at the presentation should be a positive prognostic factor, although pathology confirmed node involvement (13/38 positive) on microscopy. Since we performed an extended right hemicolectomy with lymphadenectomy (upto the main nodes), omentectomy, and removal of the perirenal fat, we believe that the combination of no organ metastasis and careful extended surgery could explain this extraordinary case of long survival. Our Department of Oncology did not propose chemotherapy for our patient due to the absence of a therapeutic protocol with proven efficacy in the literature for this rare tumor. The follow-up CT scans showed absence of disease.;

Due to the paucity of this disease, there is still no identifiable etiology, no consistent risk factors, and the pathogenesis remains unclear.CASE PRESENTATION: An 83-year-old Caucasian man presented to an emergency department with palpitations and was found to have atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization, he was found to have asymptomatic hypercalcemia with corrected calcium of 11.7. Ten days later while in rehabilitation, he started complaining of progressive fatigue and altered mental status was noted. He was found to have a calcium level of 15.5 and was admitted to the intensive care unit for management and further workup. He was found at that time to have, parathyroid hormone: < 1, 25 hydroxyvitamin D: 74, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D: 85.4, angiotensin-converting enzyme: 7, parathyroid hormone-related protein: < 2, and multiple myeloma workup was negative. Computed tomography of his chest and abdomen showed extensive retroperitoneal, pelvic, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy in addition to findings suggestive of peritoneal carcinomatosis. A right axillary lymph node biopsy showed immunohistochemical parameters consistent with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. After a lengthy discussion with his family, it was decided that no further treatment would be pursued. He had an aggressive course at the hospital during which he developed pleural effusions, ascites, and diffuse petechiae within 2 weeks, these were complications from his malignancy. Considering the poor outcomes of his aggressive disease, he decided to enroll in an out-patient hospice. He died within a few months as a result of cardiorespiratory arrest.CONCLUSION: This case illustrates a rare presentation of an extremely rare disease, that is, hypercalcemia in a patient who was later found to have angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. Diagnosing angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma might be the most challenging part due to the wide array of clinical presentations, of which hypercalcemia accounts for only 1%. As seen in this case, most patients present in advanced stages of the disease with poor prognosis.;INTRODUCTION: Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is a rare malignancy that was first described in the 1970s and was subsequently accepted as a distinct entity in the current World Health Organization classification. AITL accounts for only 2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas but is considered the most common subtype (15–20%) of peripheral T cell lymphomas. Due to the paucity of this disease, there is still no identifiable etiology, no consistent risk factors, and the pathogenesis remains unclear. AITL is considered a disease of the elderly since most patients were diagnosed in their sixth and seventh decades (median age 59–64 years). Also, almost all of these patients presented in advanced stages of the disease (stages III–IV). Presenting signs and symptoms include mainly B symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly/hepatomegaly (Table 1) [1–3]. Diagnosis can only be achieved through biopsy and histological examination of one of the enlarged lymph nodes. Specific laboratory findings seen in AITL mainly include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and bone marrow involvement (Table 2) [4]. Since it is a very rare malignancy, physicians should have a high index of suspicion and an experienced pathologist involved to identify the characteristic morphological features to be able to diagnose AITL.Table 1                      Presenting symptoms and signs in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma                     Symptoms and signsFrequency (% of patients)B symptoms68–85Generalized lymphadenopathy94–97Splenomegaly70–73Hepatomegaly52–72Skin rash48–58Polyarthritis18Ascites/effusions23–37                    Data grouped from Tobinai et al.

Data grouped from Federico et al. [4]In our case report, we discuss an 83-year-old Caucasian man who presented to an emergency department with palpitations and was found to have atrial fibrillation and asymptomatic hypercalcemia. He was finally diagnosed as having AITL. Our case was unusual in demonstrating hypercalcemia as a rare presentation of an extremely rare disease, AITL. The mechanism of hypercalcemia in this patient with AITL was not related to parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) which is the more common pathway in hypercalcemia of malignancy. Also, this case illustrates a very aggressive course of AITL leading to the death of our patient within only a few months after he opted for hospice care. We followed CARE reporting guidelines in publishing our case report with important information from our case presented as a timeline (Table 3).Table 3                      Timeline table                    Relevant past medical history and interventions Past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post one stent with new onset atrial fibrillation.Summaries from initial and follow-up visitsDiagnostic testingInterventions During hospitalization, patient started complaining of progressive fatigue and altered mental status was noted.

He is a retired building owner who lives with his spouse in a suburban area and enjoys gardening and model building as part of his hobbies. He does not smoke tobacco, he consumes alcohol occasionally, and he does not use illicit drugs. His family history is significant for colon cancer in his mother and hypertension and heart failure in his father. Prior to admission, he was on aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, and metoprolol 12.5 mg twice daily. On presentation: temperature 36.39 °C (97.5 °F), pulse 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 118/62 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical examination, he was awake, alert, and oriented to self, others, time, and place. His skin was warm, dry, with no apparent rashes. His neck was supple and non-tender with no jugular venous distension or apparent masses. A cardiovascular examination was significant for an irregularly irregular rhythm and rapid pulse, but no murmurs or gallops. He did not demonstrate any lower extremity edema and pulses were intact bilaterally. His lungs were clear with equal breath sounds. His abdomen was soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. A neurological examination showed grossly intact cranial nerves 2–12, normal sensation, strength was full bilaterally, normal reflexes, intact coordination, and normal gait. During his hospitalization, he underwent transesophageal echocardiography with cardioversion, which converted his irregular rhythm back to sinus rhythm. He was subsequently started on sotalol 80 mg twice daily and apixaban 5 mg twice daily. He was found to have asymptomatic hypercalcemia with corrected calcium of 11.7 mg/dL (8.6–10.2 mg/dL) incidentally. As part of the workup for his hypercalcemia, blood samples were sent for evaluation including vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. He was sent to in-patient rehabilitation. Ten days into his stay in rehabilitation, he started complaining of progressive fatigue and altered mental status was noted. He was found to have a calcium level of 15.5 mg/dL (8.6–10.2 mg/dL) and was admitted to the intensive care unit for management and further workup. He was managed with aggressive fluid hydration, pamidronate 90 mg administered intravenously once, and calcitonin 300 U administered subcutaneously twice daily for a total of 2 days. He was found at that time to have: PTH, < 1 pg/mL (15–65 pg/mL), 25 hydroxyvitamin D, 74 ng/mL (30–100 ng/mL), 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, 85.4 pg/mL (19.9–79.3 pg/mL), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), 7 U/L (9–67 U/L), and multiple myeloma workup was negative. PTHrP was also tested in order to identify the cause of hypercalcemia and was found to be undetectable: < 2.0 pmol/L (0.0–2.3 pmol/L). Our patient had a low LDH 131 U/L (reference range 135–225 U/L), bilirubin total was 0.55 mg/dL (reference range 0–1.2 mg/dL), and indirect bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (reference range 0.2–1.2 mg/dL). In addition, a peripheral smear showed mild normocytic normochromic anemia, with no microcytosis, favoring anemia of chronic disease/inflammation, thus our patient did not have evidence of hemolytic anemia. Hypergammaglobulinemia was evident with gamma globulin level of 2.64 mg/dL (reference range 0.62–1.51 mg/dL). Computed tomography (CT) of his abdomen with contrast showed extensive retroperitoneal, pelvic, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy in addition to extensive peritoneal and omental thickening with ascites suggestive of peritoneal carcinomatosis (Fig. 1).

Coronal and axial computed tomography images with contrast of the patient’s abdomen showing extensive retroperitoneal, pelvic, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy in addition to extensive peritoneal and omental thickening with ascitesHe underwent a right axillary lymph node biopsy, which initially revealed findings suspicious of T cell lymphoma. At the pathologist’s request, the slides were sent for consultation to a tertiary referral center. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections (Fig. 2) showed mildly enlarged lymph nodes with paracortical expansion by a polymorphous infiltrate of small lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells, and occasional immunoblasts. Such findings are suggestive of a T cell lymphoma.

Occasional secondary follicles were also present. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the paracortical lymphocytes with slightly increased pale cytoplasm were positive for cluster of differentiation (CD) 2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), with weak expression of CD10 and B cell lymphoma 6 protein (BCL6) in a subset. CD8 highlighted a minor subset of the small T cells, CD20 highlighted B cell follicles and increased paracortical immunoblasts. CD21 highlighted follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) associated with the B cell follicles and some of the high endothelial venules in the paracortex. Flow cytometry detected a small atypical T cell population with some co-expression of CD10 and a CD4/CD8 ratio of 4.5:1. T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement detected both TCR-beta and TCR-gamma clonal rearrangements. Thus, the morphological and immunohistochemical findings were found to be consistent with AITL.After long discussions with our patient’s family, the decision was made for no further treatment. He had a complex hospital course in which he developed pleural effusions, ascites, and diffuse petechiae within 2 weeks, these were complications from his malignancy. Considering the poor outcomes of his aggressive disease, our patient decided to enroll in an out-patient hospice with no further follow-up or intervention. He died within a few months as a result of cardiorespiratory arrest.DISCUSSION: This is a case of an 83-year-old man who presented with atrial fibrillation, was incidentally found to have asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and was subsequently diagnosed as having AITL. This is an unusual case that demonstrates hypercalcemia as a rare presentation of an extremely rare disease, AITL. It also illustrates a very aggressive course of AITL leading to the death of our patient within only a few months after he opted for hospice care.AITL is a rare and aggressive malignancy that is almost always diagnosed in patients when it has already reached advanced stages. The most common presenting signs and symptoms of AITL include generalized lymphadenopathy (94–97%), B symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats and so on, 68–85%), and splenomegaly (70–73%). On presentation, our patient did not have any B symptoms and no lymph nodes or splenomegaly were appreciated on physical examination. The most common laboratory findings in AITL include elevated LDH (60%), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, 35%), anemia (33%), and hypergammaglobulinemia (30%). Our case illustrates hypercalcemia as a rare presentation of an extremely rare disease. Diagnosing AITL might be the most challenging part due to the wide array of nonspecific clinical presentations, of which hypercalcemia accounts for only 1% [4]. The mechanism behind hypercalcemia in a patient with AITL is yet to be identified. PTHrP is the principal factor in cancer-induced bone disease and is responsible for 80% of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy and localized osteolysis associated with metastatic cancer, however, it was effectively excluded as the culprit in this case [5]. Our patient had an elevated 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D with normal 25 hydroxyvitamin D and low PTH, which means that the hypercalcemia was caused by the increased production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D through the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy pathway [6, 7]. The hypercalcemia did not suppress, in this case, the production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D through the suppression of PTH, as would happen in a normal physiologic response. This lack of suppression indicates that the production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D is due to an extra-renal PTH-independent production. This ectopic production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D remains unclear in lymphomas, however, proposed theories from various case studies relate it to production from tumor-associated macrophages or the malignant lymphocytes themselves [6, 7].The index of suspicion among physicians for AITL is usually low given the wide array of clinical presentations and the lack of specific laboratory findings, with the diagnosis being made through biopsy only. A lymph node biopsy of AITL is characterized by the polymorphic infiltrate that leads to partial effacement of the lymph node’s architecture and predominantly occupies the paracortical area. The architectural changes in AITL follow three overlapping patterns. Pattern 1, seen in 20% of the patients, has preserved lymph node architecture with the cortex showing hyperplastic B cell follicles with poorly developed mantle zones. Pattern 2, as seen in this patient and in 30% of the patients, is characterized by a loss of normal architecture of the lymph node and the presence of concentrically arranged FDCs. Pattern 3, seen in 50% of the patients, has complete effacement of lymph node architecture, absent B cell follicles, and prominent irregular proliferation of FDCs. All three patterns have polymorphic infiltrates. The proliferation of FDCs in AITL is best appreciated through immunostaining of the FDC markers (CD21, CD23, CD35) with most, if not all, tumor cells in AITL expressing CD10. AITL follows an aggressive clinical course despite conventional chemotherapy with median survival being less than 3 years with a 10–30% survival rate at 5 years from diagnosis. Two thirds of patients can achieve complete remission, however, they often succumb to infectious complications. Therapies used to treat individuals with AITL include corticosteroids and both single agent regimens and combined chemotherapeutic regimens such as: cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin (vincristine), and prednisone (CHOP), cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP), and vincristine, asparaginase, and prednisone (VAP). One promising therapy for the treatment of AITL is high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation [8, 9].CONCLUSION:This case illustrates a rare presentation of an extremely rare disease, that is, hypercalcemia in a patient who was later found to have AITL. Diagnosing AITL might be the most challenging part due to the wide array of clinical presentations of which hypercalcemia accounts for only 1%. As seen in this case, most patients present in advanced stages of the disease with poor prognosis. AITL often runs an aggressive course with dismal outcomes and a 5-year survival rate of only 30–35%. Despite the rarity of this malignancy, clinicians should be aware of its existence.;

Hepatic abscesses are well-documented sequelae of diverticulitis, however instances of progression to hepato-bronchial fistulization are rare. We present a case of diverticulitis associated with hepatic abscess leading to hepato-bronchial fistulization, which represents a novel disease course not yet reported in the literature.CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Caucasian man presented with a history of unintentional weight loss and dyspnea both at rest and with exertion. He had a significant tobacco and alcohol misuse history. A massive right-sided pleural effusion was found on chest X-ray, which responded partially to chest tube insertion. A computed tomography scan of his thorax confirmed the presence of innumerable lung abscesses as well as a complex pleural effusion. An indeterminate tiny air pocket at the dome of the liver was also noted. A follow-up computed tomography scan of his abdomen revealed a decompressed hepatic abscess extending into the right pleural space and the right lower lobe. A sigmoid-rectal fistula was also revealed with focal colonic thickening, presumed to be the sequelae of remote or chronic diverticulitis. An interventional radiologist inserted a percutaneous drain into the decompressed hepatic abscess and the instillation of contrast revealed immediate filling of the right pleural space, lung parenchyma, and bronchial tree, confirming a hepato-bronchial fistula. After two concurrent chest tube insertions failed to drain the remaining pleural effusion completely, surgical lung decortication was conducted. Markedly thickened pleura were seen and a significant amount of gelatinous inflammatory material was debrided from the lower thoracic cavity. He recovered well and was discharged 10 days post-thoracotomy on oral antibiotics. The percutaneous liver abscess tube was removed 3 weeks post-discharge from hospital after the drain check revealed that the fistula and abscess had entirely resolved.CONCLUSION: Refractory right-sided pleural effusion combined with constitutional symptoms should alert clinicians to search for possible hepatic abscess, especially in the context of diverticulitis. The rupture of an untreated hepatic abscess could lead to death from profound sepsis or rarely, as in this case, a hepato-bronchial fistula. Timely investigation and a multidisciplinary treatment approach can lead to improved patient outcomes.;INTRODUCTION: Diverticulosis is a common condition where colonic wall weakness and intraluminal pressures predispose to formation of outpouching in the colonic wall, termed diverticula [1, 2]. It affects 5% of individuals under the age of 40 and 65% of those aged 65 and older [3]. Most are asymptomatic and lack leukocytosis, but may present with nonspecific complaints such as lower abdominal pain, bloating or constipation [1].Diverticulitis, however, may arise when stool collects in and blocks the entrance of diverticula. This can lead to inflammation, mucous collection, and bacterial overgrowth causing distention and ischemia [4]. The treatment for diverticulitis includes bowel rest and antibiotics, which is sufficient to resolve symptoms in 75% of cases [5]. However, complications may include microperforations with pericolic abscess formation as well as macroperforations with gut-to-gut fistulization and abscess formation throughout the abdomen [1, 6, 7]. Abscesses may be treated with antibiotics and, depending on size, drainage may be indicated. Fistula generally requires surgical intervention [5]. Our case demonstrates an atypical initial presentation of diverticulitis in addition to a novel disease course, where diverticulitis lead to hepatic abscess formation, which then ruptured causing hepato-bronchial fistulization.CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Caucasian man presented to our emergency department with 20 pounds of unintentional weight loss over 2 months followed by a 2-week history of worsening shortness of breath, epigastric tenderness, and bilateral pitting leg edema. He had no symptoms of fever, cough, phlegm production, diaphoresis or night sweats. He had a 40 pack-year smoking history and 40-year history of alcohol misuse, but no significant past medical history or family history of significant medical illness. Later in the course of his current presentation, he admitted to 6 months’ history of intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea. He had attributed this to his use of alcohol and he did not seek medical care.On physical examination, he was emaciated and afebrile with a heart rate of 118 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 103/70 mmHg. His jugular venous pressure was elevated at 5 cm above the sternal angle. His abdomen was not distended but tender to light palpation in the epigastrium. He was not jaundiced. Leg pitting edema was noted from his feet up to the distal thirds of his tibia bilaterally. Auscultation of the lung fields revealed significantly decreased air entry at the base of the right lung. His oxygen saturation on room air was found to be 85%. With supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal prongs at 2L/minute he maintained an oxygen saturation of 94%.The admission blood work is presented in Table 1. Results showed an elevated leukocyte count of 24.0 × 109/L, predominately neutrophils, elevated thrombocyte count of 894 × 109/L and low hemoglobin 79 g/L with a hematocrit of 27%. Liver enzyme test results revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase 197 U/L, elevated gamma glutamyl transferase (ϒGt) 121 U/L, international normalized ratio (INR) elevated at 1.4 and C-reactive protein (CRP) elevated at 262.5 mg/L. There was a significant drop in his albumin level, at 24 g/L. Serology results did not demonstrate any evidence of hepatitis B infection. Additionally, no evidence of hepatitis B immunity was found. Hepatitis C antibodies were non-reactive.Table 1                      Admission hematology and biochemistry data                     Measured valueReference rangeHematology Leukocyte count24.0 × 109/L4.0 × 109/L – 10.0 × 109/L Hemoglobin79 g/L135 g/L – 170 g/L Thrombocytes894 × 109/L150 × 109/L – 400 × 109/L Hematocrit27%40% – 51% Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)80.8 fL79fL – 97fLEnzymes Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)16 U/L<40 U/L Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)9 U/L<39 U/L Alkaline phosphatase197 U/L40 U/L – 129 U/L Gamma glutamyl transferase (ϒGt)121 U/L<60 U/L Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)90 U/L<224 U/LCoagulation International normalized ratio (INR)1.40.9sec – 1.1sec Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)2923sec – 32secImmunology C-reactive protein (CRP)262.6 mg/L<5.0mg/LSerum electrolytes Sodium133 mmol/L135 mmol/L – 145 mmol/L Potassium4.5 mmol/L3.5 mmol/L – 5.0 mmol/L Chloride96 mmol/L98 mmol/L – 107 mmol/L Bicarbonate26 mmol/L22 mmol/L – 29 mmol/L Urea3.7 mmol/L<8.2 mmol/L Creatinine56 μmol/L62 μmol/L – 120 μmol/L Albumin24 g/L35 g/L – 52 g/L Calcium2.21 mmol/L2.15 mmol/L – 2.55 mmol/L Magnesium0.8 mmol/L0.65 mmol/L – 1.05 mmol/L Phosphate1.58 mmol/L0.80 mmol/L – 1.33 mmol/L Total bilirubin11.9 μmol/L3.4 μmol/L – 17.1 μmol/L Random glucose7.1 mmol/L3.4 mmol/L – 11.0 mmol/LThe admission chest X-ray, Fig. 1, revealed a large right lung pleural effusion with near complete opacification associated with mass effect and mild mediastinal shift toward the left hemithorax. A thoracentesis removed 1.5 L of yellow cloudy fluid from the right hemithorax in the emergency room. The pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative effusion with a fluid lactate dehydrogenase of 256 U/L, nucleated cell count of 14.3 × 109 with 86% being neutrophils, and fluid to serum amylase ratio of 1:2. Light’s criteria were assessed and consistent for exudative effusion, Table 2. The serum effusion albumin gradient (SEAG) was measured at 5g/L (serum albumin 24g/L – effusion albumin 19g/L), which is consistent with exudative effusion. The fluid was also sent for Gram stain and microbiological culture.

A right-sided Wayne catheter chest tube was inserted with ultrasound guidance the following day, however chest X-rays post chest tube insertion did not show any significant decrease in effusion size. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed to help determine the cause of the patient’s anemia. The EGD did not identify a source of bleeding, but the colonoscopy revealed an impassable diverticular stricture encountered at 25 cm from the sigmoid colon.A computed tomography (CT) scan of our patient’s thorax demonstrated a tiny gas and fluid collection in the right lobe of the liver, suggestive of decompressed hepatic abscess with extension through the right pleural space and into the right lower lobe of the lung, Fig. 2. A CT scan of his abdomen confirmed a ruptured intrahepatic abscess extending across the diaphragm into the right pleura and into small right lower lobe abscesses. Furthermore, a complicated sigmoid colon diverticulitis with a fistula to the rectum was also seen, Fig. 3.                                      Fig. 2                                                          a Computed tomography thorax scan with contrast reveals multiple air-filled lung abscesses in the right lung lobe (yellow arrows). b The air-filled lung abscess is contiguous with a small, collapsed area of hypoattenuation within liver parenchyma with central air pocket in segment 8 of the liver (red arrows). c Computed tomography abdomen and pelvis scan with portal venous phase intravenous contrast clarified a continuous track (blue arrows) from a collapsed, peripherally enhancing liver abscess (red arrows) extending across the diaphragm and in continuity with right lower lobe lung abscesses (yellow arrows)                                                                                  Fig. 3                      Computed tomography pelvis scan shows focal rectosigmoid thickening with small fistula from sigmoid to rectum (yellow arrow) in the region of inflamed diverticula suggesting complicated diverticulitis. The fistula formation suggests an element of chronicityAt this time, the general and thoracic surgery services were consulted. A decision was made to request the interventional radiology service to place a percutaneous drain to clear the remaining intrahepatic abscess. During the procedure, fluoroscopic contrast was instilled into the abscess drain and was found to track through the right hemidiaphragm into the right lung pleural space and bronchi, Fig. 4. This resulted in a sudden drop in the patient’s oxygen saturation, which resolved when the contrast was evacuated from the bronchi. A new chest tube was inserted to drain the remaining pleural fluids. Despite the intrahepatic drain and two chest tubes in situ, the patient’s pleural effusions failed to drain completely. The thoracic surgery team subsequently decided that lung decortication and exploratory bronchoscopy was indicated for the patient. The microbiological culture of the pleural fluid grew penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus anginosus, but our patient’s antibiotic regimen was not changed in order to maintain coverage for possible anaerobic and Gram-negative enteric microbes.                                      Fig. 4                                                          a Fluoroscopic view shows contrast in collapsed liver abscess (red arrows) extending upward through the capsule. b Further fluoroscopic view shows contrast tracking from the liver abscess in segment 8 (red arrow), through the right hemidiaphragm into a contained collection in the pleura (red arrow) and then into small lung abscess (yellow arrow) then filling the right bronchial tree (green arrows)Our patient was taken to the operating room, where bronchoscopy revealed clear airways with no perforations. A thoracotomy was then performed to expose the pleura, which was found to be markedly thickened. The pleura were incised and a large amount of gelatinous material was removed from the pleural cavity. Extensive decortication of the right lung resulted in significantly improved intraoperative lung inflation. A biopsy of the lung abscess was also taken. Four chest tubes were placed intraoperatively to ensure effective drainage of the pleural cavity. Our patient tolerated the procedure well and substantial lung re-expansion was observed on chest X-rays in the days following the procedure. A subsequent drain check performed by an interventional radiologist, showed a residual cavity in the right lobe of the liver and that the fistula to the pleural space was still patent. However, no continuity to the lung abscess or bronchi was observed. General surgery also opted not to surgically remove the fistula as it was felt that it would close on its own given the effective drainage that had been achieved.Ten days following his operation, our patient was discharged home with his hepatic abscess drain still in situ and with a 21-day course of ciprofloxacin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg, both orally and twice daily. An abscess check performed 3 weeks later found that the abscess had resolved without complications and the percutaneous drain was removed.The general surgery service re-assessed our patient approximately 1 month post-discharge from hospital. Our patient reported he was feeling well and denied experiencing any abdominal pain or other concerning gastrointestinal symptoms. Because of this complex diverticulitis with an increased the risk of future bacterial seeding, a lower anterior resection of the affected colon and rectum was offered to the patient. Our patient agreed to have this procedure performed laparoscopically, however significant adhesions were found intraoperatively in the pelvis preventing easy mobilization of the sigmoid colon. Subsequently, the operation was converted to an open laparatomy. The segment of colon containing the fistula was identified and resected. A tension-free end-to-end anastomosis was then created without difficulty. Our patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged from hospital 5 days following the operation. At follow-up appointments at 1 week and 1 month following his discharge, our patient again reported that he was feeling well and denied experiencing any abdominal pain or other gastrointestinal symptoms.DISCUSSION: We report the case of a 61-year-old man with perforated diverticulitis resulting in sigmoid-rectal fistulization, and hepatic abscess formation with subsequent hepatic-bronchial fistulization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case and description of a hepatic-bronchial fistulization secondary to diverticulitis.Abdominal complications of diverticulitis including perforation, bleeding, obstruction, and fistula formation are often due to bacterial overgrowth [4]. The organisms commonly implicated include Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium, and Fusobacterium spp. [8]. Bowel microperforations can cause pericolic abscess formation, while macroperforations can cause gut-to-gut fistulization and abscess formation throughout the abdomen, including hepatic abscesses [1, 6, 7].The most common route of bacterial seeding to the liver is hematogenous spread via the portal circulation. The right lobe in particular is involved in 72% of hepatic abscesses [6] as it receives the majority of portal circulation [9, 10]. The intestinal microorganisms are able to cross the gut-vascular barrier and enter the venous circulation either via various virulence factors [11], or via intestinal perforations [12] similar to those caused by diverticulitis. The formation of hepatic abscesses caused by intestinal perforations from diverticulitis has also been documented in the past [6, 7].In our case, the sigmoid colon diverticulosis with focal thickening and a fistula to the rectum was discovered on abdominal CT scan. Subsequent investigations led to the discovery of a hepato-bronchial fistulization. The complication of hepatic-bronchial fistulae has been described as a rare complication of hepatic amebiasis [13], radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma [14], or as a surgical complication after cholecystectomy [15]. However, to the best of our knowledge hepatic-bronchial fistulization from ruptured hepatic abscess resultant from a chronic perforated sigmoid colon diverticulosis has not yet been reported. As such, this case demonstrates both an atypical presentation of diverticulitis, as well as a novel course of this disease.We hypothesize that our patient suffered a perforation in the sigmoid colon due to diverticulitis, as evidenced by the sigmoid-rectal fistula, Fig. 3. This mechanical disruption allowed intestinal microorganisms to translocate into the portal circulation, seeding the liver. The subsequent hepatic abscess formation in the right hepatic lobe, Fig. 2, produced inflammation that eventually ruptured and eroded through the diaphragm and penetrated into the right pleural cavity and right lobe of the lung. As a result, a massive pleural effusion and empyema that triggered our patient’s respiratory distress and prompted his presentation to hospital, Fig. 1. The severe pleural inflammation and infection, as evidenced by the markedly thickened pleura and large volume of loculated infected material, caused fistulization to the bronchi of the right lower lobe. This final sequela was clearly demonstrated by the spread of contrast material into the bronchial tree when it was instilled into the hepatic abscess, Fig. 4. The pericolic abscess formation, hepatic abscess formation, and hepatic-bronchial fistulization have all been described occurring as independent clinical phenomena, however, our case clearly demonstrates a novel stepwise clinical course initially triggered by probable remote, untreated perforated diverticulitis.The initial presentation in our emergency department with epigastric tenderness could have been referred pain from a right upper quadrant liver pathology and/or pathology in the right lower lobe of the lung. We believe during the stepwise care our patient received, the chest X-ray revealed a large pleural effusion which focused the provider on the lung pathology and the epigastric pain associated with anemia focused the provider on the possibility of an upper gastrointestinal bleed. This case clearly illustrates the utility of Ishikawa diagrams in delineating possible etiology when presented with gastroenterological and pulmonary symptoms. In our case this was expanded and refined based on other associated symptoms followed by radiological and laboratory examinations [16].The lack of fever, negative blood cultures, and negative hepatic abscess fluid cultures were certainly unexpected. These negative findings could be due to concurrent antibiotic therapy or imperfect culture sensitivity, both of which are known factors associated with culture-negative infections [17]. The pleural fluid drained did grow Streptococcus anginosus, a member of the Streptococcus milleri group, known for their tendency to cause abscesses [18]. In particular, S. anginosus is isolated significantly more frequently than other group members in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems [19], adding further support for an intestinal source of infection in this case.Pyogenic hepatic abscesses are treated with aspiration of the abscess including aspirate cultures to determine the causative organisms and antibiotic susceptibilities. Concurrent empiric intravenous antibiotics covering enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes are also utilized [20]. The antibiotic therapy can be narrowed once susceptibilities are available, and should continue for 4–6 weeks [20]. In cases of hepatic-bronchial fistulization, management of the hepatic abscess is the same as described above, and this generally also resolves the respiratory symptoms without additional therapy [12, 13, 15]. In cases with refractory pleural effusions or empyema, the management begins with chest tube drainage of the complicated pleural fluids [21]. Surgical decortication can be employed for non-refractory cases [21]. In our case, the appropriate empiric intravenous antibiotics were started and the hepatic abscess was drained. To address his stage III [22] empyema, thoracentesis was performed and two chest tubes were placed. Our patient demonstrated little improvement following these interventions, and lung decortication was eventually required.Our patient’s behavior with respect to seeking medical care is another important aspect of this case. Our patient described 20 pounds of unintentional weight loss over 2 months as well as a 6-month history of intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea. However, despite these very concerning symptoms, our patient did not seek any medical attention. It was not until his shortness of breath began to interfere with his daily activities that he decided to seek medical attention. This case illustrates the importance of assessing patients’ healthcare-seeking behavior. When patients are found to seek healthcare very infrequently, it should raise a clinician’s index of suspicion for an acute exacerbation of an undiagnosed chronic condition.Consultations to both the radiology service for the CT thorax scan and the gastroenterology service for endoscopy to rule out a gastrointestinal source of bleeding were done at the same time. The gastroenterology service was able to review our patient first, prior to the CT thorax scan being obtained. Subsequently, the CT thorax scan revealed a tiny gas and fluid collection in the right lobe of the liver, suggestive of a decompressed hepatic abscess with extension through the right pleural space and into the right lower lobe of the lung. On review of the management our patient received, it is possible that because his anemia and respiratory findings were so significant the care providers were distracted from investigating the 6-month history of intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea that he endorsed at his initial presentation. These symptoms are indeed suggestive of an abdominal source such as diverticulitis and as such an abdominal CT scan could have been performed earlier. This would have led to faster discovery of the etiology of his underlying pathology.Additionally, a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) should have been measured after the colonic stricture was discovered as an elevated CEA suggesting malignancy would have significantly changed his management. Fortunately, the pathology report on the colonic specimen from his lower anterior resection did not note any signs of malignancy.CONCLUSION:Hepatic abscess leading to hepato-bronchial fistula is a rare cause of massive pleural effusion and empyema that can lead to poor outcomes if the diagnosis is missed or delayed. Hepato-bronchial fistulization from a hepatic abscess should be considered when patients present with refractory pleural effusion, constitutional symptoms, and intestinal disease such as diverticulitis. Timely CT imaging of the thorax and abdomen is key in making the diagnosis, and for best patient outcome, a multidisciplinary approach involving disciplines such as pulmonary medicine, interventional radiology, and thoracic surgery is warranted.;

However, if bleeding unfortunately occurs, the risks and benefits of anticoagulation present a challenge. Management of one hemorrhagic complication, retroperitoneal hematoma, is rare, difficult, and controversial.CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old white man presented with left lower extremity swelling and dyspnea. He was tachycardic, hypertensive, and demonstrated poor oxygen saturation of 81% on ambient air. A computed tomography angiogram revealed a saddle pulmonary embolus. Tissue plasminogen activator was administered and he was started on a heparin infusion. He was eventually transitioned to enoxaparin. On the day of discharge, however, he had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below his hip. A computed tomography of his head was not concerning for stroke, and neurology was consulted. Neurology was concerned for spinal cord infarction versus hematoma and recommended magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic and lumbar spine. The magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left psoas hematoma. A computed tomography scan of his pelvis also showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma. He was transitioned to a low intensity heparin infusion. The following day his left leg exhibited similar symptoms. There was concern of progressive and irreversible nerve damage due to compression if the hematomas were not drained. Interventional radiology was consulted for drainage. The heparin infusion was paused, drainage was performed, and the heparin infusion was reinitiated 6 hours following the procedure by interventional radiology. His blood counts and neurologic examination stabilized and eventually improved. He was discharged home on a novel anticoagulant.CONCLUSION: Management of a retroperitoneal hematoma can commence with recognition of the warning signs of bleeding and neurological impairment, and consulting the appropriate services in case the need for intervention arises. A conservative approach of volume resuscitation and blood transfusion can be used initially, with the need for pausing or reversing anticoagulation being assessed on an individual basis with expert consultation. If intervention becomes necessary, other interventional radiology-based modalities can be used to identify and stop the bleeding source, and interventional radiology-guided drainage can be performed to decrease the hematoma burden and relieve neurological symptoms.;INTRODUCTION: The management of retroperitoneal hematomas in the setting of critical anticoagulation is rare, difficult, and controversial. There exists the need to strike a delicate balance. Management can commence with early recognition of the warning signs of occult bleeding and neurological impairment, and consulting the appropriate services in case an imminent need for intervention arises. A conservative approach of volume resuscitation and blood transfusion can be used initially, with the need for pausing or reversing anticoagulation being assessed on a case-by-case basis with expert consultation. If intervention becomes necessary, modalities such as transarterial embolization (TAE) can be used to identify and stop the bleeding source, and interventional radiology (IR)-guided drainage can be performed to decrease the hematoma burden and relieve neurological symptoms. Finally, as with all clinically complex cases, patient awareness and informed consent play a major role in how the plan is implemented. We describe a case in which a patient was admitted to our hospital after sustaining a saddle pulmonary embolus (PE), received appropriate anticoagulation, and subsequently developed bilateral retroperitoneal hematomas as a complication of therapy. This case highlights an unexpected complication of a commonly treated condition, as retroperitoneal hematomas in the setting of anticoagulation are rarely reported in the literature [1]. In addition, our publication review yielded very few case reports in which retroperitoneal hematomas occurred as a complication of pulmonary embolism treatment specifically.CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old white man presented to our emergency department with a 3-day history of left lower extremity swelling and acute-onset shortness of breath. On evaluation, he was tachycardic with a pulse of 113, hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 130-170 mmHg, and demonstrated poor oxygen saturation of 81% on room air. He was supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen while a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was obtained, which revealed a saddle PE (Fig. 1).                                      Fig. 1                      Computed tomography showing the saddle pulmonary embolusTissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered and he was started on a heparin infusion and admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for management. He remained on the heparin infusion for 3 days, during which he continuously improved and was eventually weaned to 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula. On hospital day 2, he was transferred to intermediate level of care. Per hematology recommendations, he would have to be on indefinite anticoagulation due to the massive PE he had sustained, the source of which was a left lower extremity popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The plan was to transition him from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin twice per day with hematology follow-up in 1 month.On the day of discharge, however, he had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below the level of his hip. He had previously been working with physical therapy and had been able to walk 200 feet with the assistance of a walker during each session. A physical examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch, 2/5 strength in right hip flexion and right knee extension and flexion, and loss of right patellar reflex. Left leg physical examination was normal at that time.An emergent head computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered due to concern for a possible stroke, and neurology was consulted. The head CT was negative for infarction or hemorrhage. Neurology was concerned for spinal cord infarction versus hematoma and recommended emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his thoracic and lumbar spine. The MRI revealed a left psoas hematoma (Fig. 2). A CT of his pelvis performed the same day also showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma. Due to these findings, hematology recommended discontinuing enoxaparin and reverting to a low intensity heparin infusion, as well as placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The following day his left leg began exhibiting the same symptoms as his right leg. There was concern regarding the risk of progressive and irreversible nerve damage due to compression if the hematomas were not promptly drained. IR was consulted and advised that if the drainage were to occur while our patient was on anticoagulation, the risk of rebleeding into the retroperitoneum would be high and potentially nullify any benefit from drainage. Our patient would also be at risk of hemodynamic instability if the current hematomas were acting as tamponades against further bleeding. An additional complicating factor was the risk of further thrombosis due to the presenting saddle PE. Hematology was consulted for recommendations on pausing anticoagulation, but they were hesitant to offer a timeframe as there was no established safe period to enable this type of procedure to take place. Eventually, a window period of pausing the heparin infusion for 3 hours pre-procedure and up to 6 hours post-procedure was decided upon in the event that our patient agreed to have the drainage performed.                                          Fig. 2                        Magnetic resonance imaging showing the left psoas hematomaThroughout this sequence of events, our patient and his wife were aware of the plans and considerations on how to proceed. They were informed of the recommendations and concerns made by neurology, hematology, and IR, as well as the risks and benefits of intervention versus non-intervention.After speaking with his wife, our patient decided to undergo the procedure. The low intensity heparin infusion was stopped 3 hours beforehand and the IR team then performed drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma, placing two pigtail catheters in our patient’s right flank (Fig. 3). In total, the hematoma was drained of 215 milliliters of blood, 10 milliliters of which were drained during the procedure itself. The left psoas hematoma was not found to be amenable to drainage.                                          Fig. 3                        Computed tomography showing interventional radiology-guided drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematomaOur patient tolerated the procedure well, and the heparin infusion was restarted 6 hours after it was completed. A repeat neurological examination demonstrated improved lower extremity strength bilaterally as well as the return of sensation to light touch. Hip flexion improved to 3/5 bilaterally, and knee flexion and extension improved to 4/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes remained absent. Four days later, the pigtail catheters were removed. His recovery was complicated by anemia requiring blood transfusions totaling 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Other sources of potential bleeding were evaluated and not found. A repeat CT on hospital day 10 (Fig. 4) showed a stable right-sided hematoma, and our patient did not experience any further neurologic deficits. He was transitioned again from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin after 3 more days. His hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable. During this time, he worked with physical therapy, who recommended discharge to a skilled nursing facility where his strength began to improve somewhat. Follow-up was scheduled with neurology and hematology. On hospital day 18, he was safely discharged.

In most cases the duplicated segment was derived from a parent being a reciprocal translocation carrier. However, about 15 cases with de novo 9p duplication have been reported previously. Clinically, this condition is characterized by mental retardation, short stature, developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, hand and toe anomalies, heart defects and/or ocular manifestations.CASE PRESENTATION: We report here the case of a 2-year-old Moroccan girl with a de novo duplication of 9p24 to p12. Clinical manifestations included failure to thrive, psychomotor delay, microcephaly, dysmorphic features, equinus feet, and umbilical hernia. Further clinical investigations showed an insulin-like growth factor type 1 deficiency. Banding cytogenetics identified a derivative chromosome 9, with an abnormally elongated short arm. Molecular cytogenetics based on multicolor banding probes characterized an inverted duplication 9p24 to p12 involving several genes especially an insulin-like growth factor binding protein named insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like 1, which seemed to be overexpressed, leading to the insulin-like growth factor deficiency in our patient.CONCLUSION: This study showed that insulin-like growth factor type 1 deficiency can be another feature of 9p duplication, suggesting a likely involvement of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like 1 overexpression in growth delay. However, further studies of the gene expressions are needed to better understand the phenotype-karyotype correlations.;INTRODUCTION: 9p duplication is a structural chromosome abnormality first described by Rethoré and colleagues [1]. To date more than 150 cases have been reported, however, the duplication is often due to a parental reciprocal balanced translocation, that is, beside the 9p duplication another chromosomal region is present in one copy only [2]. De novo duplications of this chromosomal region have been described in only about 15 cases, up to now [3–9]. Nonetheless, clinically this is a recognizable spectrum with specific major features like failure to thrive, psychomotor delay, mental retardation, craniofacial abnormalities (microcephaly, downslanting palpebral fissures, deep-set eyes, hypertelorism, bulbous nose, short philtrum, downturned corners of the mouth, short neck), digital abnormalities (fifth finger clinodacyly, brachydacyly, dysplastic nails), as well as skeletal malformations [10]. Here, we describe a case of a patient admitted for different clinical problems including insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) deficiency with partial trisomy of 9p.CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient, a 2-year-old girl, was the third child of healthy nonconsanguineous parents of Moroccan origin, born at term after an uneventful 39-week gestation and normal delivery, she was admitted for genetic evaluation because of psychomotor delay and failure to thrive. Her birth weight was 2500 g (3rd centile), length was 46 cm (3rd centile), and head circumference was 32 cm (3rd centile). Her family history was unremarkable for developmental delay or recurrent miscarriages. The proposita sat at 18 months, but her walking and language acquisition were delayed. On clinical examination, her length, weight, and head circumference at 2 years old were as follows: 68 cm (<3rd centile), 8 kg (<3rd centile) and 44 cm (<3rd centile). She had mild dysmorphic features similar to that of the 9p duplication syndrome. She had hypertelorism, deep-set eyes, broad nasal bridge and bulbous nasal tip, short philtrum, downturned mouth, retrognathia, and short neck. Additional findings included large anterior fontanelle, fifth finger clinodactyly, left equinus foot, and umbilical hernia. Further evaluation revealed growth hormone deficiency with decreased serum level of IGF-1, estimated at 47 ng/mL, whereas normal values are between 51 and 327 ng/mL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of pituitary gland was normal.Chromosomal analysis was performed on cultured peripheral lymphocytes of our patient and her parents according to standard methods. R banding at the resolution level of 400 bands was performed, as well as C banding after barium hydroxide treatment. RHG analysis (R-banding of human chromosomes by heat denaturation and Giemsa staining) showed a derivative of chromosome 9 with a 9p arm notably expanded. The extra band was C banding negative, thus excluding pericentric inversion of the 9qh region. This was interpreted as representing either a 9p duplication or some other rearrangement. Since parental karyotypes were both normal, our patient’s karyotype was designated as 46,XX,der(9)?dn (Fig. 1).

Probe labeling, hybridization post washing, signal detection, and image acquisition were performed as previously reported [12, 13]. For characterization of the heteromorphic patterns of chromosome 9, further probe set was applied [14, 15].FISH experiments identified the extra segment as a duplication of 9p24 to 9p12. The karyotype could be characterized after the application of the probes mentioned above. There was a partial trisomy 9p24 to 9p12. The region 9p24 to 9p12 was duplicated and inserted inverted in 9p12~13 (Fig. 2). The final karyotype was designated as follows: 46,XX,der(9)(pter->p12~13::p12->p24::p12~13->qter)dn.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-016-1086-1;Scleroderma and dentistry: Two case reports;;;INTRODUCTION: Scleroderma is a chronic connective tissue disorder with unknown etiology. It is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the connective tissues causing vascular disturbances which can result in tissue hypoxia. These changes are manifested as atrophy of the skin and/or mucosa, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and internal organs. Such changes can be classified into two types, namely, morphea (localized) and diffuse (systemic). Morphea can manifest itself as hemifacial atrophy (Parry–Romberg syndrome) although this remains debatable. Hence, we present a case of morphea, associated with Parry–Romberg syndrome, and a second case with the classical signs of progressive systemic sclerosis.CASE PRESENTATION: Case one: A 20-year-old man of Dravidian origin presented to our out-patient department with a complaint of facial asymmetry, difficulty in speech, and loss of taste sensation over the last 2 years. There was no history of facial trauma. After physical and radiological investigations, we found gross asymmetry of the left side of his face, a scar on his chin, tongue atrophy, relative microdontia, thinning of the ramus/body of his mandible, and sclerotic lesions on his trunk. Serological investigations were positive for antinuclear antibody for double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid and mitochondria. A biopsy was suggestive of morphea. Hence, our final diagnosis was mixed morphea with Parry–Romberg syndrome.Case two: A 53-year-old woman ﻿of Dravidian origin presented to our out-patient department with a complaint of gradually decreasing mouth opening over the past 7 years. Her medical history was noncontributory. On clinical examination, we found her perioral, neck, and hand skin to be sclerotic. Also, her fingers exhibited bilateral telangiectasia. An oral examination revealed completely edentulous arches as well as xerostomia and candidiasis. Her serological reports were positive for antinuclear antibodies against centromere B, Scl-70, and Ro-52. A hand and wrist radiograph revealed acro-osteolysis of the middle finger on her right hand. Hence, our final diagnosis was progressive systemic sclerosis.CONCLUSION: Through this article, we have tried to emphasize the importance of a general examination when diagnosing rare systemic diseases such as scleroderma and the role of the general dentist when caring for such patients, even though they can be quite rare in general practice.;INTRODUCTION: Scleroderma is a chronic sclerosing disease of the connective tissues. It derives its name from the Greek words scleros (hard) and derma (skin). Hidebound skin is an important and characteristic feature of this disease thereby making the name “hidebound disease” more popular [1, 2]. The first description of this disease as a separate pathological entity was given by Carlo Curzio of Naples in 1752 [2, 3] and its first name, “sclerodermie,” was given nearly a century later by Gintrac in 1847. For years, the disease was thought to be a dermatological disorder but after its distinctive characteristic of systemic involvement was proven, Goetz coined the term “progressive systemic sclerosis” in 1945 [2, 4].Scleroderma exists in two forms: morphea (circumscribed scleroderma) and generalized/progressive (diffuse scleroderma). However, some articles have mentioned acrosclerosis (scleroderma of the peripheries associated with Raynaud’s phenomenon) as a third form [5, 6]. Morphea (localized scleroderma) is again subdivided into five types, namely: plaque, generalized, bullous, linear, and deep [7, 8]. CREST syndrome (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia), a rare condition, is thought to be a heterogeneous variant of systemic scleroderma [9]. Similarly, Parry–Romberg syndrome (hemifacial atrophy) is thought to be another variant of scleroderma. However, this remains debatable [8, 10, 11].Scleroderma was described as a pathological entity in the mid-eighteenth century but to date the exact etiopathogenesis is still unknown, possibly because of the disease’s rarity. However, it is understood that age, gender, genetic, and environmental factors can influence vulnerability for the disease [2]. Some authors have suggested viral or bacterial infection (Borrelia burgdorferi), particularly in the case of morphea, as the causative agent. But sufficient evidence to support such claims is lacking [8]. Untimely interaction of immunity with the vascular system resulting in endothelial damage is also hypothesized as a major contributor for the initiation and progression of the disease [2, 12].Systemic sclerosis (diffuse/generalized/progressive scleroderma) initially manifests itself as pitting edema of the skin which progresses to a thickening and hardening of the skin. The systemic form can involve multiple organs, such as the kidneys, lungs, heart, and the gastrointestinal system, among which the involvement of the latter is most common. These organs are affected either by fibrosis or by a diminished blood supply. Raynaud’s phenomenon (paroxysmal vasospasm), claw-like fingers, hyperpigmentation, telangiectasia, and subcutaneous calcification are other common systemic manifestations that can be seen. Oral and facial tissues are the most affected, manifesting as the characteristic mask-like face (Mona Lisa face), constricted lips (fish mouth), a narrowing and stiffening of the tongue (chicken tongue), microstomia, pseudoankylosis, resorption of the mandibular angle, xerostomia, dental caries, and a widening, radiographically, of periodontal ligaments [2, 13]. Oral ulceration, secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is also reported in some cases [6]. Most of the time, as a result of these manifestations, patients visit dentists for these aesthetical and facial dysfunctions.Morphea (localized scleroderma), on the other hand, causes localized fibrosis similar to scleroderma, resulting in localized indurated lesions [14]. As mentioned earlier, morphea can be subdivided into five different types. Mixed forms, such as localized scleroderma of the face with plaque/linear morphea at some other site, have been reported in the literature [15].The face is the most common site for the linear type of morphea with fibrosed tissue appearing as a sabre cut (en coup de sabre) resulting in facial hemiatrophy mimicking Parry–Romberg syndrome [2]. Hence, with this article we are presenting two such cases of scleroderma reporting to us with aesthetical and facial dysfunctions. Both cases were later diagnosed as mixed morphea, with Parry–Romberg syndrome, and progressive systemic sclerosis, respectively.CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old man of Dravidian origin presented to our Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with the chief complaint of facial asymmetry over the past 2 years. According to him, and on review of photographs he had brought, his facial symmetry was within normal limits prior to these past 2 years. He also reported difficulty in articulation and a loss of taste sensation. He also presented with skin lesions on his trunk (abdomen and back).His medical and family histories were noncontributory. On general examination, he was found to be conscious and oriented. His vital signs were within normal range. He had limited, well-circumscribed, and oval-shaped hyperpigmented lesions on his abdomen and back (Fig. 1). These lesions appeared fibrotic on palpation. A head and neck examination revealed gross asymmetry of the left side of his face and there was a sharp demarcation on his chin, separating the normal and abnormal side (Fig. 2).

His left ear pinna appeared to be fibrosed on palpation. Skin on the affected side appeared to be sclerotic. An ocular examination disclosed no abnormalities. An intraoral examination revealed shrunken and rigid left side of his tongue otherwise his mucosa appeared to be normally moist (Fig. 3). A hard tissue examination offered no relevant findings.                                          Fig. 3                        Atrophy of tongue (left side)Hence, our provisional diagnosis was facial hemiatrophy with plaque morphea and further investigation was recommended.Panoramic view showed relative microdontia on the left side, with a thinning of his mandibular body and ramus (Fig. 4). Submentovertex and posteroanterior views also revealed gross asymmetry of the left side of his jaw. Serological investigations were positive for double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and antimitochondrial antibody, however, his erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were normal.                                          Fig. 4                        Panoramic view showing gross asymmetry of face (left side) with relative microdontia and thinning of ramus/body of mandibleFundoscopic examination of his eyes and audiometry showed no abnormalities. Ultrasonography examinations of his bilateral buccal mucosa and parotid glands were normal. A skin biopsy revealed a thickened epidermis with sparse adnexal structures. Thickened and closely packed collagen bundles in reticular dermis, along with hypocellularity and sparse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the dermis, were suggestive of morphea.After correlating these findings with the available literature, the final diagnosis of mixed morphea with Parry–Romberg syndrome was given.A 53-year-old woman of Dravidian origin visited our department complaining of difficulty in using her complete dentures as a result of the gradual reduction in mouth opening over the previous 7 years. She also complained of a burning sensation of her oral mucosa (predominantly in her palate) and a tightness of the skin in her perioral and neck regions. On clinical examination we found her face to be expressionless. On palpation, the skin of her perioral and neck regions was sclerotic (Fig. 5). The skin on her fingers also appeared to be pale on inspection and indurated when palpated. According to our patient, this paleness spreads symmetrically to all ten fingers when exposed to cold, suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon. Her fingers also showed areas of telangiectasia (Fig. 6). An oral examination revealed completely edentulous maxillary and mandibular arches, microstomia due to rigid perioral skin, xerostomia (positive tongue blade test), and an erythematous patch on her palate. The clinical findings were suggestive of progressive systemic sclerosis, hence, we recommended radiological and serological investigations. For the erythematous lesion, a swab was taken and was sent for culture. These investigative reports were consistent with our provisional diagnosis.

In addition, a radiograph of her hand and wrist revealed reabsorption of the terminal phalanges (acro-osteolysis) of the middle finger on her right hand (Fig. 7). A swab culture was positive for candidiasis, which reflected alteration of her oral microflora secondary to xerostomia, resulting in a burning sensation.

This syndrome occurs usually with a hematological tumor, but in this case our patient had a solid tumor, which was a rare extraskeletal osteosarcoma, localized in her pelvic region. She also had lung metastases and bilateral hydronephrosis.After spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome, she had acute renal insufficiency, which was treated with hemodialysis and successively with rasburicase, Kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate), and febuxostat.CONCLUSION: Tumor lysis syndrome represents an oncological emergency, which must be suspected and treated as soon as possible.;INTRODUCTION: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is one of the major oncological emergencies, disruption is caused by massive tumor cell lysis in which the contents of the lysed tumor cells are released into the bloodstream [1]. It is a potential fatal complication of the treatment of hematological tumors and, less frequently, of solid aggressive tumors. Hematologic malignancies comprise the vast majority of TLS, which is believed to be secondary to treatment sensitivity and rapid proliferative rates [2, 3]. Patients with a solid tumor usually show TLS after intensive chemotherapy (treatment-induced TLS), but sometimes it can appear before the treatment (spontaneous TLS) especially in cases of bulky tumors with wide necrotic areas. TLS can alter the body’s homeostatic mechanisms and cause hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and uremia [4].Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) is a rare subtype of osteosarcoma without attachment to bone or periosteum. It accounts for less than 4% of all osteosarcomas and approximately 1 to 2% of all soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) [5]. The clinical features of patients with this tumor differ significantly from the clinical features of patients with skeletal osteosarcoma, including older age, propensity for axial tumors, and female preponderance.Although ESOS has been found to develop in all organs, the most common locations are limbs. In the case of abdominal or pelvic lesions the diagnosis can be very difficult, thus it requires confirmation after exploratory laparotomy and histopathology. Such tumors may reach an enormous size before detection, because the enlarging mass may not be associated with pain. ESOS may be one of the differential diagnoses to be considered in the case of calcified masses arising in retroperitoneal space [5, 6].In previous studies, the total number of patients reported with both tumor lysis and sarcoma was five: three males and two females and their age spanned from 9 years to 66 years. All of them had evidence of advanced and metastatic disease [5–10]. One patient was reported to have normal baseline values of creatinine and phosphorus, whereas another patient had elevated baseline values of creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Three cases were preceded by chemotherapy, the other two cases were represented by spontaneous TLS. All the cases taken in consideration had baseline elevation of uric acid and phosphorus.Clinical tumor lysis occurred more frequently in patients with pre-treatment renal insufficiency than in patients with normal renal function. The development of uremia is correlated with high pre-treatment serum LDH concentrations [4].CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old white woman was hospitalized for a right hypochondrium colicky pain radiating to the ipsilateral subscapularis region. Her pain was not related to food and posture. It appeared during the previous week and persisted despite nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. A clinical examination showed that her abdomen was swollen in the right iliac fossa and the presence of voluminous palpable mass that was hard, fixed to the deep layers, and sore to touch.An abdominal ultrasound (US) examination revealed her liver with gallbladder stones, a heterologous formation in her right iliac fossa with internal calcification, which compressed the iliac vessels, and a bilateral hydronephrosis more marked on the right than on the left.Laboratory tests revealed significant alterations (Table 1). Her blood pressure was above 180 mmHg. A chest X-ray showed the presence of multiple metastases placed in both lung fields. A total body computed tomography scan (CT) without contrast confirmed the presence of lung metastases, bilateral hydronephrosis, and a mass in her right iliac fossa invading her ureter and her iliac artery.Table 1                      Laboratory tests before and after hemodialysis                    Laboratory testsBefore dialysisAfter dialysisReference rangeAlkaline phosphatase IU/l146067020–140Urea nitrogen mg/dl196.258.310–50Creatinine mg/dl7.891.360.60–1.50Phosphorus mg/dl4.94.22.6–4.5Calcium mg/dl7.57.78.5–10.5Sodium mmol/l144136135–145Potassium mmol/l6.14.23.4–4.8Lactate dehydrogenase U/l1120870110–210Uric acid mg/dl11.46.73.6–8.5There was also a mass in the right iliac mass but with a reduced size in the left iliac fossa invading her psoas muscle. The internal structure of the masses was homogeneous, apart from the centrally located amorphous high-attenuation areas. There was no fat inside the lesion.She underwent hemodialysis and infusion therapy with rasburicase (Fasturtec ®, Table 1).Prompt dialysis is necessary when treatment fails to normalize electrolytes or establish urinary flow. Hemodialysis removes excess circulating uric acid. Before the dialysis our patient was hyperuricemic and oliguric. After the dialysis, we observed that she developed diuresis, associated with the consequent resolution of hyperuricemia, hyperazotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and normalization of electrolytes.After 10 days she underwent surgery. An exploration of her abdominal cavity detected a retroperitoneal mass in her right iliac region which involved the last ileal loop besides compressing the iliac vessels and infiltrating her ureter. Another mass in her left iliac fossa caused a compression of the left iliac vessels and ureter without infiltration. As a result of the inoperability of the mass in her right iliac region, an ileotransversostomy was performed with enucleation of the left mass and cholecystectomy.An histological examination performed on the mass diagnosed an ESOS infiltrating her psoas muscle, her internal iliac artery, and her bladder wall. On macroscopic examination the mass had a hard consistency, was whitish-gray in color, and there were large central calcified parts and areas of hemorrhagic-necrotic tissue. The mass was osteoblastic histological type, consisting of osteoblasts producing an osteoid material. The lesional cells showed great cytological atypia, high mitotic activity, and permeative growth pattern (Fig. 1).                                      Fig. 1                      Round and multinucleated cells separated by osteoid material (×200)The tumor massively invaded our patient’s abdominal cavity and metastasized in both lung fields. According to these parameters, she was in a very poor prognostic subgroup, due to a very bulky and high growth rate tumor. This tumor was only partially resectable because she was over 60-years old and showed multiple metastatic lesions, multiorgan impairment, and increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. A CT scan showed large soft tissue masses with focal or massive areas of calcification and no osseous involvement. Magnetic resonance (MR) images showed intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a low-to-hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images.The diagnosis of osteoblastic ESOS was confirmed by the tumor localization within the soft tissue, without attachment to bony structures, and the presence of abundant osteoid. There was no history of radiation or trauma in our patient, but there was an anamnestic finding of hysterectomy just 6 months before the diagnosis of ESOS.The most common presentation of ESOS is a gradually enlarging mass that varies in size from 1 to 50 cm in diameter and does not always imply pain. Very large and bulky tumors often develop in the retroperitoneum before their detection as in our case. Thus the presence of metastatic lesions, the patient’s age, and the size were the major prognostic factors, in addition, patients with very large lesions have a worse clinical outcome.DISCUSSION: ESOS is a high-grade malignant mesenchymal neoplasm with very aggressive behavior. The tumor is typically located in the deep soft tissues, without attachment to skeletal bones. The most common affected site is the thighs, followed by upper extremities, retroperitoneum, and buttocks.The etiology of ESOS is essentially unknown, even though there have been reported cases of radiation-induced ESOS, a history of previous trauma, intramuscular injection at the tumor site, and malignant transformation of myositis ossification. ESOS has also been shown to develop in unusual sites, such as mediastinum, hand, cerebellum, heart, skin, pleura, larynx, scalp, tongue, penis, gallbladder, breast, and mesentery.The treatment of choice for ESOS is amputation or a wide surgical resection of the tumor for local control and to prevent a possible recurrence. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can be combined to surgery although their role in neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy has not been clearly defined yet. Nevertheless, classical high-grade ESOS still remains a very aggressive rare tumor with a poor prognosis.Our patient had a spontaneous TLS, with an acute renal insufficiency, treated with hemodialysis (Table 1). After this treatment, TLS was treated with rasburicase, Kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate), abundant hydration, and febuxostat (Fig. 1) [11, 12].Risk factors for TSL include: (1) presence of bulky disease, particularly with pluri-metastatic sites (especially abdominal metastases), bulky adenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, (2) high leucocyte count, (3) elevated pre-treatment LDH, (4) elevated pre-treatment uric acid, (5) compromised renal function, and (6) history of use of potentially nephrotoxic drugs [7].The most frequent serological alteration is: hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Both hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia can evolve in renal failure and they can also cause cardiologic complications. The contemporaneous presence of the two electrolytic alterations may cause a fall in cardiologic function [8–10]. Hyperuricemia results from the release and breakdown of purine nucleic acids. Uric acid is poorly soluble in water and, when normal limits of excretion are surpassed, precipitation of crystals occurs in the renal tubules leading to renal insufficiency and, potentially, failure [13].Malignant cells often have a higher phosphate concentration than normal cells. Rapid lysis can lead to hyperphosphatemia when the normal homeostatic mechanisms are overwhelmed. Excretion of phosphate may be further impaired because of acute kidney injury either from uric acid crystal deposition or from tumor involvement of the kidneys [14]. In the setting of hyperphosphatemia, calcium phosphate precipitation may also occur in renal tubules, contributing further to acute kidney injury [15]. Hyperphosphatemia may also cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, or seizures. Hypocalcemia in TLS is a consequence of hyperphosphatemia, causing calcium phosphate precipitation in tissues.TLS may be clinically asymptomatic, but hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia may cause neurologic, cardiovascular, or muscular symptoms including seizures, arrhythmias (typically with a longer QT space), and tetany. Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening consequence of TLS, occurring when large quantities of potassium are released from necrotic tumor cells. Acute kidney injury, if present, can worsen hyperkalemia. A rapid increase in serum potassium levels may result in cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac arrest [16–18].In neoplastic patients, acute tumor lysis may be a cause of acute renal failure (ARF) due to severe metabolic derangement. Acute TLS has rarely been investigated and most patients developed spontaneous and oliguric ARF before therapy. The cause of renal failure is now recognized as acute uric acid nephropathy, due to increased uric acid production and hyperuricosuria resulting from a high tumor cell turnover rate. A key distinction between spontaneous tumor lysis and TLS is the lack of hyperphosphatemia in the spontaneous form occurring after therapy.We searched PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Sciences articles that focused on TLS in patients with osteosarcomas published from 1960 to September 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-018-1570-x;Primary purulent bacterial pericarditis due to Streptococcus intermedius in an immunocompetent adult: a case report;;;INTRODUCTION: Acute purulent bacterial pericarditis is of rare occurrence in this modern antibiotic era. Primary involvement of the pericardium without evidence of underlying infection elsewhere is even rarer. It is a rapidly progressive infection with high mortality. We present an extremely rare case of acute purulent bacterial pericarditis in an immunocompetent adult patient with no underlying chronic medical conditions.CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old previously healthy white man presented with the complaints of chest pain and dyspnea. He was diagnosed as having acute pericarditis and was discharged home on indomethacin. Over a period of 2 weeks, his symptoms worsened gradually and he was readmitted to our hospital. He was found to have large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. An urgent pericardiocentesis was done with drainage of 550 ml of purulent material. Cultures grew Streptococcus intermedius confirming the diagnosis of acute purulent bacterial pericarditis. No other focus of infection was identified on imaging workup suggesting primary infection of the pericardium. His clinical course was complicated by development of constrictive pericarditis for which he underwent surgical pericardiectomy. He received a total of 7 weeks of intravenously administered antibiotics with complete clinical recovery.CONCLUSION: Acute purulent bacterial pericarditis, although rare, should always be kept in mind as a possible cause of pericarditis. Early recognition and prompt intervention are important for a successful outcome.;INTRODUCTION: Bacterial pericarditis is a rapidly progressive infection with high mortality. It is rare in the modern antibiotic era and the majority of cases occur in immunocompromised individuals or in individuals with underlying disease of the pericardium [1, 2]. Bacterial pericarditis usually occurs as a secondary infection by contiguous spread from surrounding intrathoracic focus of infection or by hematogenous spread from distant focus of infection [2, 3]. Primary involvement of the pericardium without evidence of underlying infection elsewhere is very rare. We present a case of a 33-year-old immunocompetent previously healthy adult patient who was diagnosed as having primary purulent acute bacterial pericarditis caused by Streptococcus intermedius.CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old white man presented to our hospital with sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea of 1 day’s duration. The chest pain started when he was lifting a heavy trash bag and described the pain as sharp, constant, and radiating to his back. He also complained of diffuse body aches and chills but denied any fever, cough, hemoptysis, or weight loss. He denied any history of dental caries, recent travel, or exposure to sick contacts. He had no significant past medical history and was not taking any routine medications. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 10 years and denied any alcohol or illicit drug use. He worked as a waste collector in a garbage disposal firm.At the time of presentation, he was: alert, oriented in time, place, and person, afebrile with a temperature of 37.06 °C (98.7 °F), tachycardic (heart rate of 110 beats/minute), and tachypneic (respiratory rate of 18/minute) with a blood pressure of 126/78 mmHg. An oral examination revealed normal dentition. A cardiopulmonary examination showed normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs and clear lung fields to auscultation bilaterally. An abdominal examination revealed a soft, non-tender abdomen with no organomegaly. A neurological examination showed intact cranial nerves and sensory system, and his muscle strength was 5/5 in all limbs with normal tone. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. An initial laboratory workup showed mild leukocytosis with white blood cell (WBC) count of 13,700 cells/mm3, elevated inflammatory markers of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 48 mm/hour and C-reactive protein (CRP) 84 mg/dl, and moderately elevated serum transaminases of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 634 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 326 U/L. A basic metabolic panel was within normal limits. Three sets of cardiac enzymes done 8 hours apart were normal. An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed sinus tachycardia and diffuse ST segment elevations. A chest radiograph showed normal bilateral lung fields and normal cardiac silhouette. Computed tomography (CT) of his chest (Fig. 1) ruled out aortic dissection but showed pericardial effusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction of 55% and a small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade physiology.                                      Fig. 1                      Axial computed tomography scan of chest showing pericardial effusionHe was diagnosed as a case of acute pericarditis with minimal pericardial effusion. He was discharged home on indomethacin and was asked to follow up in the out-patient clinic. Two weeks later, when he was seen in our out-patient clinic, he complained of worsening dyspnea and chest pain. He was readmitted to hospital and an urgent transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained, which showed moderate to large pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology with right ventricular diastolic collapse and dilated inferior vena cava (Fig. 2). An emergency pericardiocentesis was done and approximately 550 ml of purulent pericardial fluid was drained. The pericardial fluid was sent for culture, cell analysis, and cytology. Pericardial fluid WBC count was 15,376 cells/mm3 with 98% segmented neutrophils. A Gram stain of the pericardial fluid showed Gram-positive cocci in chains. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with intravenously administered vancomycin (dosed on trough concentration) and piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 8 hours). Pericardial fluid cultures grew alpha hemolytic streptococci which were characterized as S. intermedius by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS). S. intermedius was susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone. Anaerobic, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures were negative. Pericardial fluid cytology was also negative for any malignant cells. Extensive workup with CT abdomen, CT chest, urine analysis, urine culture, and blood culture to look for source of infection failed to identify any other focus of infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis QuantiFERON testing were negative. Antibiotics were deescalated to intravenously administered ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hours) as per culture sensitivity.                                      Fig. 2                      Transthoracic echocardiogram (four chamber view) showing pericardial effusion with presence of internal septationsHis hospital course was complicated with the development of a pulmonary embolism for which he was started on an intravenously administered heparin infusion. However, within a few days of starting heparin, there was a steady decline in his platelets count. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was suspected and heparin infusion was stopped. Our patient was started on argatroban infusion at a rate of 140 mcg/minute. HIT antibodies and serotonin release assay were sent which came back positive. He was subsequently transitioned to orally administered warfarin with target international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2 to 3. However, with the course of time, he did not have complete resolution of symptoms with persistence of chest pain and dyspnea. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic features were consistent with development of constrictive pericarditis. Surgical pericardiectomy with median sternotomy approach was performed which revealed thickened pericardium (Fig. 3). He reported improvement in his symptoms after pericardiectomy. He was discharged home in a stable condition and received a total of 7 weeks of intravenously administered ceftriaxone. Six months post-discharge he reported complete resolution of his symptoms. A repeat echocardiography was normal and showed resolution of pericardial effusion.                                      Fig. 3                      Gross pathological specimen of pericardium after pericardiectomyDISCUSSION: We report a case of primary purulent acute bacterial pericarditis in an immunocompetent previously healthy adult patient caused by S. intermedius. Our patient presented with symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain, which gradually progressed over the course of 2 weeks. He was found to have large purulent pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade and was managed with emergent pericardiocentesis and intravenously administered antibiotics. Further, the disease course was complicated with development of constrictive pericarditis, which was successfully managed with pericardiectomy. Acute pericarditis can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, which can be infectious or noninfectious [4]. Possible causes include connective tissue disorders, malignancies, radiation, cardiac injury, uremia, and infections (including viral, bacterial, and fungal etiologies) [4, 5]. In a majority of cases (80 to 90%), the cause of pericarditis is not identified [5, 6]. These cases are considered to be idiopathic, most likely due to an undetected underlying virus [5, 6]. Bacterial pericarditis is a rare cause of acute pericarditis in the modern antibiotic era. The reported incidence is < 1% of all cases of pericarditis [7, 8]. The most common organisms implicated are Streptococci, Staphylococci, Haemophilus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [3, 9].Bacterial pericarditis usually occurs as a secondary infection by contiguous spread from surrounding intrathoracic infection, including extension from pulmonary, myocardial, and subdiaphragmatic site of infection or by hematogenous dissemination from a distant infection elsewhere in the body [2, 3]. Among these, direct extension from lung or pleura (pneumonia and pleural empyema) accounts for the majority of cases [3, 10]. Very rarely, it can occur as a primary infection without evidence of underlying infection elsewhere. The common predisposing conditions for bacterial pericarditis are immunosuppression, malignancies, preexisting pericardial effusion, alcoholism, uremia, chest trauma, cardiac and thoracic surgery, and insertion or use of catheters for draining pericardial fluid [9, 10]. Purulent pericarditis is a serious manifestation of bacterial pericarditis characterized by the presence of frank pus in the pericardial cavity. It is an acute fulminant disease with rapid progression. It is associated with high mortality and a large number of cases are identified after death [2]. If not identified and treated promptly the mortality rates can be as high as 100% [11]. Even with treatment, the rate of complications and death is high, with the mortality rate approaching 40% [3, 9]. Death is most likely secondary to cardiac tamponade, constriction, and sepsis [3, 9].Clinical recognition of bacterial pericarditis can be difficult as classical manifestations of acute pericarditis such as chest pain, pericardial friction rub, and pulsus paradoxus may be absent and a patient may present with nonspecific signs and symptoms of infection. Fever is present in almost all of the patients [3]. Chest pain, which can be pleuritic or nonpleuritic, is seen in 25 to 37% of patients [3, 10]. Pericardial friction rub and pulsus paradoxus are seen in less than 50% of patients [3, 10]. Laboratory workup may show evidence of systemic inflammation with leukocytosis, and elevated CRP and ESR [9]. Elevated troponins are seen in approximately 50% of cases [12]. Chest radiograph usually shows cardiomegaly with abnormal cardiac silhouette. Pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and mediastinal widening may be identified as well [9]. Electrocardiogram findings of acute pericarditis are present in a majority of patients, however, in 10 to 35% of cases findings may be normal [9, 10]. Echocardiogram is the most sensitive test and shows presence of fluid in the pericardial cavity in almost all the patients. However, it is not possible to differentiate purulent fluid collections from other causes of acute pericarditis based on echocardiogram alone. If purulent pericarditis is suspected an urgent pericardiocentesis should be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic indications and fluid should be sent for cell count, Gram stain, culture, and fungal and acid-fast stain. If tuberculous pericarditis is suspected, then performing polymerase chain reaction and adenosine deaminase activity assays on fluid increase the diagnostic yield [13]. Medical therapy includes immediate initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with antistaphylococcal agent and an aminoglycoside, which can be followed by 4 weeks of bactericidal antibiotic as per culture and sensitivities. For critically ill patients the empiric antibiotic should include vancomycin, third generation cephalosporin, and a fluoroquinolone [9]. Surgical pericardiectomy is indicated in selected patients with incomplete resolution and complications of the disease.Our case is an extremely rare case of primary purulent acute bacterial pericarditis in a previously healthy adult individual with no immunocompromising or chronic medical condition, caused by S. intermedius. S. intermedius is a member of the Streptococcus anginosus group. The S. anginosus group (also called Streptococcus milleri group) is a subgroup of viridans streptococci that includes three streptococcal species: S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus. Although these organisms are a part of normal commensal of oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract, they are capable of causing various pyogenic infections and abscess formation [14]. They have been associated with abscess formation in the liver, abdomen, brain, and lung but rarely cause purulent pericarditis.From a search of the medical literature, we identified a total of 22 cases of bacterial pericarditis caused by S. anginosus (milleri) group from 1984 to 2017 [3, 15–34]. Out of these, five cases were attributed to S. intermedius [18, 28, 31, 34]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the sixth reported case of bacterial pericarditis caused by S. intermedius. In our case, the source of S. intermedius infection was unclear and development of pericarditis was spontaneous without evidence of any other infective focus elsewhere. S. intermedius is a part of normal microbial flora of human oral cavity as discussed earlier. We believe that the most likely etiology of infection in our case was transient bacteremia from a mucosal breach in our patient’s oral cavity with hematogenous spread and seeding of bacteria in pericardial cavity leading to purulent pericarditis.CONCLUSION:Acute purulent bacterial pericarditis, although rare, should always be kept in mind as a possible cause of pericarditis. As this disease has a rapidly progressive fulminant course, early recognition and prompt intervention are critical for a successful outcome.;

Synchronous multiple primary lung cancer is defined as multiple lung lesions that develop at the same time, whereas metachronous multiple primary lung cancer describes multiple lung lesions that develop at different times, typically following treatment of the primary lung cancer. Patients with previously treated lung cancer are at risk for developing metachronous lung cancer, but with the success of computed tomography and positron emission tomography, the ability to detect both synchronous and metachronous lung cancer has increased.CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 63-year-old Hispanic man who came to our hospital for evaluation of chest pain, dry cough, and weight loss. He had recently been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe, with a poorly differentiated carcinoma favoring squamous cell cancer based on bronchoalveolar lavage of the right lower lobe for which treatment was started. Later, bronchoscopy incidentally revealed the patient to have an endobronchial lesion that turned out to be mixed small and large cell neuroendocrine lung cancer. Our patient had triple synchronous primary lung cancers that histologically were variant primary cancers.CONCLUSION: Triple synchronous primary lung cancer management continues to be a challenge. Our patient’s case suggests that multiple primary lung cancers may still occur at a greater rate than can be detected by high-resolution computed tomography.;INTRODUCTION: In both men and women, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Risk factors associated with lung cancer include environmental risk factors, genetic factors, and tobacco smoke exposure. Patients with lung cancer are at an increased risk of developing secondary lung cancers at the same time as the first (synchronous) or later in life (metachronous). In these cases, it is critical to determine whether the secondary tumor is an independent primary tumor or a recurrence or metastasis of the first primary tumor, because this determination influences how the disease is staged and managed as well as the patient prognosis.In 1924, the first case of two distinct primary lung cancers was published by Beyreuther et al. [1], and in 1975, Martini and Melamed [2] introduced the clinicopathological criteria for the diagnosis of multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC). The incidence of synchronous lung cancer (SLC) ranges from 0.2 to 8% [3], whereas continuous exposure to smoking increases the risk that a patient will develop metachronous primary lung cancer. In patients with small cell lung cancer, the overall risk of a second lung cancer is 3.5 times higher than in the general population [4]. After undergoing complete resection of non-small cell lung cancer, patients have a 1–2% risk per patient per year that of developing another lung cancer [5].We identified a unique case of triple SLC, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and mixed small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, which has poor prognostic implications. Biopsy of the other lesions helped us differentiate metastatic disease from primary lung cancer. The fact that our patient had three different primary cancers made treatment challenging.CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old homeless Hispanic man diagnosed with lung cancer 5 months previously in our hospital presented with ongoing sharp chest pain of 2 weeks’ duration, shortness of breath, chronic dry cough, and weight loss of 20 pounds within 2 months. The patient also had experienced physical activity limitations for the previous 2 months. He denied experiencing diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, and he did not have anorexia, fever, chills, or phlegm production.The patient’s past medical history included a cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness, bronchial asthma, lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIB) diagnosed by computed tomography (CT)-guided right upper lobe biopsy 5 months previously. He was receiving adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. His social history included 55 pack-years of smoking and a family history of cancer, his mother had colon cancer, and his brother had an unknown type of cancer. He had no environmental exposures. He was taking aspirin and atorvastatin and was using an albuterol inhaler and a fluticasone inhaler.The patient was cachectic and afebrile on physical examination, with a blood pressure of 146/84 mmHg, and his oxygen saturation was 94% with administration of 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. He had bilateral grade 3 clubbing and a bronchial breath sound in the right upper lobe. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds, and the patient’s abdomen was soft with no organomegaly. In addition, laboratory analyses of the patient’s peripheral blood and urine were normal, although his sodium levels were low.A chest x-ray showed a persistent right upper lobe mass (Fig. 1a). This was further evaluated by review of a chest CT scan (Fig. 1b), which showed a large, rounded consolidation of the right apical parenchyma measuring 5 × 4.7 × 4 cm without necrosis or calcification. A right hilar soft tissue mass measuring 3.7 × 2.1 × 3.6 cm, consistent with focal adenopathy, was also seen. He had undergone a CT-guided lung biopsy of the mass in the right upper lobe during a previous admission, which had revealed the following immunochemical characteristics: thyroid transcription factor-1-negative, napsin-negative, cytokeratin 7 (CK7)-positive, and CK20-negative. In addition, the patient had negative test results for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), K-ras, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations, all consistent with adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2a–c). A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage from the right lower lobe revealed clusters of poorly differentiated carcinoma cells, which supported the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 3). The patient was receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed, which revealed hypermetabolic activity in the 6-cm mass in the right upper lobe (standardized uptake value [SUV] 14.4), right hilar nodes (SUV 2.8), and 1.5-cm left hilar lymph nodes (SUV 4.9) (Fig. 4a–c). No hypermetabolic foci were found within the neck, abdomen, or pelvis. Results of other tests, including a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan, were negative. A pulmonary function test revealed a reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity ratio, moderately decreased FEV1, and moderate obstruction.

An endobronchial lesion in the left main stem (Fig. 5) was an incidental finding during the procedure. The endobronchial biopsy revealed the following immunohistochemical results: neuron-specific enolase-positive, synaptophysin-positive, CD56-positive, CK7-negative, chromogranin-negative, napsin A-negative, p63-negative, and CK5/6-negative, consistent with high-grade mixed small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (Fig. 6a, b). The patient was started on chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. After completing four cycles of chemotherapy, he had no significant response to the treatment. Owing to functional decline, he finally chose hospice care.

The criterion for SLC classification, as described by Martini and Melamed et al. [2], is a secondary tumor that is physically distinct and separate than the primary or a secondary tumor that has a different histology from the primary tumor, if it has the same histology, it must be located in a different segment or lobe. The definition of metachronous MPLC includes having a secondary tumor that is histologically different from the primary tumor or a histologically identical tumor that occurs at least 2 tumor-free years after the primary tumor, is located in a different lobe, and arises in the absence of extrapulmonary metastases at diagnosis [3].Antakli et al. [7] made modifications to the criteria of Martini and Melamed [2]. They added a further definition to the metachronous criteria for secondary tumors that have the same histology as the primary tumor. These criteria for metachronous MPLC include the presence of two or more of the following characteristics: are anatomically distinct from the primary tumor, have an associated premalignant lesion, have different deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy, and have no systemic metastases or mediastinal spread [7].There are multiple challenges associated with diagnosing a second primary lung cancer. First, if the secondary tumor arises within 2 years of the primary tumor, it is challenging to determine whether that tumor is a new primary tumor or a result of a residual metastasis from the original primary tumor. Second, if the secondary tumor is of the same histological type, it complicates the diagnosis of a new cancer because it is plausible that a secondary tumor of the same histological type could be an extension of the original cancer. Third, if the secondary tumor arises in an area impacted by radiotherapy (given as a treatment for the primary tumor), there can be further uncertainty whether the secondary tumor is a result of metastasis from the original tumor rather than a new cancer. Additionally, a synchronous second primary cancer judged to have associated metastatic disease would classify the patient as stage IV, which would likely contraindicate a potentially curative resection. The erroneous designation of a metachronous second primary cancer as a local recurrence might have similar therapeutic implications. A steadily growing hypothesis, known as field cancerization, suggests that carcinogenic exposure or genetic factors affect tissues or organs, potentiating many cells in the same area to become transformed [8].Analysis of the clonal origin of tumors can help determine whether multiple lung tumors arise from the same clone and therefore the same tumor. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene (chromosome 17) occur frequently in lung carcinoma, with rates up to 70% in small cell lung cancer and 50% in non-small cell lung cancer. Studies have shown that p53 mutational analysis is good diagnostic tool for diagnosing multiple SLC in 35 to 66% of cases [9]. In addition, mutation of EGFR is a common early event in lung cancer pathogenesis, and therefore it is a useful marker, alone or with p53, for differentiating the clonal origin of lung tumors, especially when multiple tumors have similar histopathological features [10]. Analysis of loss of heterozygosity is also common. Tumors that derive from a single clone may contain cell populations that harbor similar genetic events, including loss of heterozygosity [11]. This analysis has enhanced the ability to distinguish between independent primary tumors and recurrence or metastasis [12].Multiple synchronous primary lung cancers should be treated as two separate and distinct tumors, including their staging and treatment [13]. Management of metachronous lung cancer depends on various factors, including patient pulmonary reserve, comorbid conditions, and clinical staging of the secondary lung cancer at diagnosis. The American College of Clinical Pharmacy guidelines for treating patients with MPLC (synchronous or metachronous) recommend extrathoracic imaging (head CT/magnetic resonance imaging, and either abdominal CT with a bone scan or PET-CT) and invasive mediastinal staging before curative surgical resection [14]. Patients with synchronous or metachronous MPLC are often treated surgically if there will be sufficient pulmonary reserve after multiple lesions are resected. This is illustrated in a retrospective analysis by Battafarano et al., who showed that surgical intervention is safe and effective for patients with resectable metachronous lung cancer and good pulmonary reserve [15]. However, patients with limited pulmonary reserve might be limited to treatment by limited resection (e.g., segmentectomy or wedge resection), or definitive nonoperative local therapy. Patients who do not qualify for surgical resection may receive conventional radiation therapy, stereotactic whole-body radiation therapy (also called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy), or percutaneous image-guided tumor ablation [16, 17].Multiple retrospective analyses have illustrated the prognostic implications of MPLC. Lee et al. [18] demonstrated that early tumor staging is the key factor in determining survival following surgical resection in metachronous lung cancer. Riquet et al. [19] demonstrated a lower overall 5-year survival rate in patients with synchronous MPLC than in patients with metachronous MPLC, however, the 5-year survival rate was increased in patients with synchronous MPLC in one lobe compared with those with synchronous MPLC in another lobe. Additionally, Rosengart et al. [20] reported significantly higher survival rates for patients with synchronous or metachronous MPLC than in those with metastatic or locally recurrent disease (patients with synchronous or metachronous MPLC reported to have a 23% 5-year survival rate), and Jiang et al. [21] illustrated that patients with MPLC had increased overall survival compared with patients with intrapulmonary metastasis. Ha et al. [22] showed that patients with stage I metachronous second primary lung cancer have worse survival than those who present with their first primary lung cancer.There are four histological lung tumor types: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, and mixed large and small cell carcinoma. Usually, lung cancers have a single histological type, however, there are reports of patients with MPLC with different histology, including our patient. Jung-Legg et al. [23] reported a synchronous MPLC composed of a small cell carcinoma, bronchial carcinoid, and adenocarcinoma of the right lung, and Wcisło et al. [24] described an MPLC composed of an adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma. Yoon et al. [25] reported a synchronous triple primary lung cancer that included a squamous cell cancer, invasive mucinous, and nonmucinous adenocarcinoma. Our patient’s case is particularly interesting and rare. In a single patient, we identified three primary lung cancers (triple SLC), classified as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and mixed small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.CONCLUSION:MPLC can be defined as synchronous or metachronous, and the management of patients with MPLC continues to be a challenge. Although the use of high-resolution CT has increased the ability to diagnose MPLC, our patient’s case suggests that MPLCs may still occur at a greater rate than can be detected.;
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-017-1483-0;A young female presenting with unilateral sacroiliitis following dengue virus infection: a case report;;ANA: Antinuclear antibody, CMV: Cytomegalovirus, CRP: C-reactive protein, EBV: Epstein–Barr virus, ESR: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, FeSO4: Ferrous sulfate, HIV: Human immunodeficiency virus, HLA: Human leukocyte antigen, HObs: Human osteoblasts, IL-6: Interleukin-6, MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging, NS1: Nonstructural protein 1, NSAIDs: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, OPG: Osteoprotegerin, RANKL: Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, RRV: Ross River virus;INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a common arthropod-borne viral infection in Sri Lanka which is spread by the mosquitos of the genus Aedes. The clinical features of dengue include high-grade fever associated with arthralgia and myalgia. However, dengue virus is not considered an arthritogenic virus. We report a case of a previously healthy young female who presented with imaging-confirmed right-sided sacroiliitis 10 days after developing dengue fever. This is the first reported case that shows a possible link between dengue infection and development of arthritis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Sri Lankan female presented to our medical unit with right buttock and hip pain of 3 weeks’ duration. She had serologically confirmed dengue infection 10 days prior to the onset of buttock pain. A clinical examination revealed features of right sacroiliitis. An X-ray of her sacroiliac joint showed joint space widening and reactive bone changes. Magnetic resonance imaging of her pelvis and sacroiliac joint confirmed the diagnosis of acute sacroiliitis. She had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 110 mm first hour with a normal C-reactive protein. Her human leukocyte antigen-B27, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, chikungunya antibody, hepatitis serology, Brucella serology, and tuberculin skin test were negative. She was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and showed gradual improvement.CONCLUSION: After excluding possible causes for sacroiliitis, we postulated that sacroiliitis in the index case could have been caused or triggered by dengue virus infection. However there is a possibility that the sacroiliitis merely coincided with the dengue virus infection. This case illustrates the possibility that dengue virus could have a link with the development of arthritis in the same manner as other arthritogenic viruses, possible mechanisms for this include direct invasion of the synovium and the joint tissue by the virus, immune complex formation and deposition in the joint tissue, and immune dysregulation. Further studies are needed in this field to gain more knowledge, as dengue infection is highly prevalent in Sri Lanka.;INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a common arthropod-borne viral infection in Sri Lanka which is spread by the mosquitos of the genus Aedes: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. It has a high global prevalence with 128 countries being affected and a 3.9 billion people at risk [1]. In spite of the implementation of national dengue control methods including environmental management and legislation, and chemical and biologic vector control methods, in 2016, 55,150 cases of dengue were reported from Sri Lanka indicating the high burden of the disease [2, 3].The clinical manifestations of dengue infection have a wide spectrum although many who are infected with the virus remain asymptomatic. The clinical syndrome can vary from mild undifferentiated fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The virus can affect the heart, liver, and nervous system giving rise to clinical sequelae of myocarditis, hepatitis, dengue encephalopathy, and various other reported neurological complications such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and brachial neuritis [4, 5]. It can also give rise to oral manifestations such as erythema and crusting of the lips, vesicles and hemorrhagic bulla on the tongue, and buccal mucosa [6].The fever that occurs in dengue virus infection is associated with severe arthralgia and myalgia. However, dengue virus is not considered an arthritogenic virus. Arthritogenic viruses include rubella virus, hepatitis B and C, parvovirus, and alphaviruses such as chikungunya virus [7]. Dengue virus is a flavivirus and so far not reported to cause arthritis.We report a case of a previously healthy young girl who presented with imaging-confirmed right-sided sacroiliitis 10 days after developing dengue fever. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case that shows a possible link between dengue infection and development of arthritis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Sri Lankan girl presented to our medical unit with right-sided buttock pain and hip pain of 3 weeks’ duration. She had been in good health before she developed fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and headache approximately 5 weeks earlier. A nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen test for dengue fever had been positive and hematological and biochemical investigations were compatible with dengue fever. She was treated at a local hospital where she had an uneventful recovery and was discharged after 6 days. Ten days after the onset of fever (4 days after the discharge) she developed right-sided buttock and hip pain with difficulty in walking. She was readmitted to the local hospital and was managed as post-viral arthritis. She was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids. Her symptoms improved and she was discharged home. However, her symptoms recurred after a few days and had persisted with worsening pain.She did not have other small or large joint pain or swelling and there was no history suggestive of inflammation of enthesitis. She did not have fever during this episode. She did not have red eyes, dysuria, or skin eruptions. There was no preceding history of a diarrheal illness, sore throat, or any illness other than dengue fever. There was no past history of joint pains, recurrent oral ulceration, or photosensitive rashes. There was no history of altered bowel habits or bloody diarrhea suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease. There was no family history of arthritis or autoimmune diseases. There was no past history or contact history of tuberculosis.On examination she was mildly pale. There was no uveitis, oral ulceration, or skin lesions. Her cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and abdominal examination were normal. There was tenderness over her sacroiliac joint and sacroiliac stretch maneuvers were positive suggestive of right-sided sacroiliitis. Her left-side sacroiliac examination was normal. There was no tenderness over her spine and the straight leg raising sign was negative. A neurological examination of her lower limbs was normal. The rest of the joint examination was normal as well.An X-ray of her sacroiliac joint revealed features of right-sided sacroiliitis with joint space widening and reactive bony changes surrounding the joint (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her sacroiliac joint revealed evidence of right sacroiliac joint inflammation with surrounding marrow edema and reactive bony changes suggestive of acute right-sided sacroiliitis (Fig. 2).

She was treated with orally administered diclofenac sodium 50 mg every 8 hours and acetaminophen for the pain. Her symptoms gradually improved with NSAIDs and her ESR reduced to 70 from 110 after 1.5 weeks of treatment. Physiotherapy was arranged at the local hospital and she is to be followed up at regular intervals in our unit as well as at the rheumatology clinic.DISCUSSION: Dengue fever usually manifests with significant musculoskeletal symptoms including arthralgia and myalgia. However, dengue virus as a cause of arthritis is not reported so far. Our patient was a previously healthy girl who developed serologically proven uncomplicated dengue fever and later on developed imaging-proven right sacroiliitis 10 days after the onset of dengue. Whether the dengue was the cause or the triggering factor for the sacroiliitis or whether it was an entirely different pathology that merely coincided with the dengue is a dilemma. However, the fact that there was no preceding history of spondyloarthropathy and most of the known causes of sacroiliitis were excluded raises the possibility that sacroiliitis may be linked with dengue.Sacroiliitis can occur in isolation due to infectious causes or as part of an inflammatory arthropathy, mainly seronegative spondyloarthropathy. The most common bacterial infections that have a predilection for sacroiliac joints are brucellosis and tuberculosis, which usually cause unilateral disease [8, 9]. Non-brucellosis and non-tuberculous infective sacroiliitis is rare, yet staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were among the most frequently identified [10]. In our patient, serology for Brucella and tuberculin skin test were negative and blood cultures did not isolate any organism. She did not have fever or any other constitutional symptoms, which makes an infective etiology unlikely. Sacroiliitis is an early feature of spondyloarthropathies and this group consists of ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease-related arthritis, and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies [11]. These conditions usually cause a bilateral symmetrical or asymmetrical arthritis. Our patient did not have a history of joint diseases, enthesitis, uveitis, conjunctivitis, urethritis, or altered bowel habits pertaining to any of the clinical entities mentioned above. Her HLA-B27 was negative as well. Other inflammatory arthritis that can give rise to sacroiliitis include Behçet’s disease, gout, and, rarely, rheumatoid arthritis [12]. However, she did not have recurrent oral ulceration or any other features that fulfil the criteria for Behçet’s disease and HLA-B51 was negative. Her serum uric acid was normal and rheumatoid factor was negative as well.Several viruses are also implied as the causes of arthritides. Viruses can cause infection or act as cofactors in the development of rheumatic diseases. The viruses that usually cause arthritis include rubella, mumps, parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, EBV, CMV, and the group of arthritogenic alphaviruses such as chikungunya, Ross River virus (RRV), Barmah Forest virus, Sindbis virus, o'nyong-nyong virus, and Mayaro virus [7, 13]. However, most of these cause symmetrical polyarthritis or asymmetrical oligoarthritis. Chikungunya virus was linked to sacroiliitis in one reported case. Nisar and Packianatha described a case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with bilateral sacroiliitis 1 year after contracting chikungunya [14]. She had a very strongly positive chikungunya IgG titer and the rest of the serological investigations were negative for other possible causes of spondyloarthropathy. Therefore they postulated a possible link between chikungunya virus and the development of spondyloarthropathy. In our patient chikungunya antibody was negative as well as hepatitis, EBV, and CMV serology.There are several hypothesized mechanisms of the pathogenesis of arthritis following viral infection. These postulated mechanisms are:1.                      Direct invasion of the synovium and the joint tissue due to tropism of these viruses for the synovial tissue, for example rubella virus and vaccine, parvovirus.                     2.                      By means of immune complex formation and deposition in the joint tissue as the viral particles act as antigenic components, for example alphaviruses, hepatitis B and C, and parvovirus.                     3.                      Latent viruses, immune dysregulation, and virus-induced autoimmunity: where the viruses remain in the host cells expressing viral antigens on the cellular surface inducing a chronic inflammatory status or viruses directly invade the components of the immune system and cause immune dysregulation resulting in autoimmune diseases (for example HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus 1, or hepatitis C virus) [15–17]. Molecular mimicry may cause abnormal self-reactivity by altering immune tolerance [18].                     4.                      Chen and colleagues showed that primary human osteoblasts (HObs) could be productively infected by RRV and the RRV-infected HObs produce high levels of inflammatory cytokine including interleukin-6 (IL-6) resulting in increased receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) but decreased osteoprotegerin (OPG) [19]. This elevation in RANKL/OPG ratio favors osteoclast leading to an increase in bone reabsorption and bone pathologies. They also reported that inhibition of IL-6 alleviates inflammation and targeting IL-6 early by using anti-IL-6R antibodies, such as tocilizumab, will likely be therapeutically beneficial [19].Direct invasion of the synovium and the joint tissue due to tropism of these viruses for the synovial tissue, for example rubella virus and vaccine, parvovirus.By means of immune complex formation and deposition in the joint tissue as the viral particles act as antigenic components, for example alphaviruses, hepatitis B and C, and parvovirus.Latent viruses, immune dysregulation, and virus-induced autoimmunity: where the viruses remain in the host cells expressing viral antigens on the cellular surface inducing a chronic inflammatory status or viruses directly invade the components of the immune system and cause immune dysregulation resulting in autoimmune diseases (for example HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus 1, or hepatitis C virus) [15–17]. Molecular mimicry may cause abnormal self-reactivity by altering immune tolerance [18].Chen and colleagues showed that primary human osteoblasts (HObs) could be productively infected by RRV and the RRV-infected HObs produce high levels of inflammatory cytokine including interleukin-6 (IL-6) resulting in increased receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) but decreased osteoprotegerin (OPG) [19].

They also reported that inhibition of IL-6 alleviates inflammation and targeting IL-6 early by using anti-IL-6R antibodies, such as tocilizumab, will likely be therapeutically beneficial [19].Therefore, there is a possibility that the dengue virus too can affect the joint tissues by the means of the above mechanisms, particularly the first two, and it is an area that needs to be explored. These viral arthritides are usually mild and self-limiting, lasting no longer than a few weeks. There is no specific treatment and simple symptomatic measures with analgesics are sufficient [20].CONCLUSION:Even though dengue infection causes significant musculoskeletal symptoms it was not reported to cause arthritis. Here we presented a case of a previously healthy young girl who presented with unilateral sacroiliitis following dengue virus infection. After excluding other possible causes for sacroiliitis, we postulated that sacroiliitis could have been caused or triggered by dengue fever in this patient but there is a possibility that the sacroiliitis merely coincided with the dengue fever. This case illustrates the possibility that dengue virus could have a link with development of arthritis in the same manner as other arthritogenic viruses, possible mechanisms for this include direct invasion of the synovium and the joint tissue by the virus, immune complex formation and deposition in the joint tissue, and immune dysregulation. Further studies are needed in this field to gain more knowledge, as dengue infection is highly prevalent in Sri Lanka.;
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-018-1670-7;Substance-induced anxiety disorder after one dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine: a case report;;;INTRODUCTION: In this report, we describe a case of a patient with substance-induced anxiety disorder occurring after a single dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Furthermore, we describe the use and efficacy of the Primary Care Behavioral Health model, a collaborative approach to integrative primary mental health care, in evaluating and treating this rare mental health disorder.CASE PRESENTATION: Three days following ingestion of one dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a 35-year-old Hispanic man with no significant prior mental health history and no history of prior 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine use presented to our hospital with severe, acute anxiety and panic symptoms. He was initially treated with a combination of behavioral therapy and the serotonin agonist buspirone. Buspirone ultimately proved ineffective, so it was discontinued in favor of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline. While awaiting the pharmacological onset of sertraline, the patient worked with a behavioral health consultant, who provided psychoeducation on the experience of panic, building relaxation skills, and modifying maladaptive thought patterns. Enhanced communication between the primary care provider and behavioral health consultant facilitated the planning and enactment of the patient’s care plan. Approximately 2.5 months after his initial ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, the patient’s symptoms subsided. This improvement was attributed to the combination of the behavioral health intervention and sertraline at a dose of 50 mg daily. Six months after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ingestion, the patient began to gradually taper sertraline and has had no resurgence of anxiety symptoms to date.CONCLUSION: Our patient’s case not only demonstrates a rare presentation of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced anxiety disorder but also provides support for the use of the Primary Care Behavioral Health model to deliver individualized, timely mental health care in a primary care setting.;INTRODUCTION: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), more commonly known as “molly” in its pure form and as “ecstasy” historically, is a drug that gained popularity in the 1980s and continues to be used around the world [1, 2]. Current data suggest that MDMA use is prevalent in the United States. According to the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 609,000 people over the age of 12 years had used MDMA in the previous month, and among adults aged 26 years or older, 6.5% reported lifetime use of MDMA, and 0.1% reported MDMA use in the previous month [2]. Recreational users have reported that the drug induces “feelings of intimacy and closeness to others” and “positive mood” [3, 4]. Acute (< 1 day) and subacute (1–7 days) negative effects of the drug include confusion/delirium, loss of appetite, insomnia, panic/anxiety, low mood/depression, and difficulty concentrating, with low mood typically occurring 3–4 days after MDMA use [4]. The longer-term psychological effects of MDMA are more difficult to define, in part because many MDMA users are polydrug users and in part because of the high prevalence of comorbid disorders such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia [1]. Even less is known about the possible long-term effects of a one-time dose of MDMA, though several case reports, including the present one, highlight lasting effects after a single dose [5, 6].The drug’s chief psychopharmacological target is the monoaminergic system, which plays a role in emotional regulation and physiological arousal [1, 7]. Research in rodents and nonhuman primates has consistently demonstrated an MDMA-triggered release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from nerve terminals [7, 8]. Repeated doses of MDMA lead to damage of serotonergic nerve terminals, perhaps via increasing free radical activity, and there is concern and some clinical evidence for long-term depletion of serotonin and changes to the serotonergic neural network in heavy users of MDMA [1, 7]. Alterations in serotonergic activity have long been implicated in anxiety disorders, and feelings of panic/hyperarousal are induced by increased activity of epinephrine and norepinephrine, adding strength to the hypothesis that MDMA use can elicit anxiety and panic symptoms [9].Patients’ concerns regarding illicit substance use (e.g., MDMA use) and mental health are increasingly addressed and treated in the primary care setting. Primary care facilities provide an easily accessible and comfortable space to discuss a wide range of medical and psychiatric concerns [10]. In fact, 50–70% of people experiencing psychological or behavioral conditions receive their treatment in primary care settings from primary care providers (PCPs) [11, 12], and 80% of individuals with a mental health disorder report that they will visit their PCP at least one time within a calendar year [13]. Thus, PCPs are the most likely health care providers to assess and treat substance use concerns.Recently, some pioneering medical clinics have begun to adopt a Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) model with the aim of strengthening integration between physical and mental health care. This approach is particularly applicable to and beneficial in treating patients with depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder symptoms or concerns. These patients often benefit from both psychopharmacological and behavioral health treatment. The PCBH model has a population-based health focus and aims to meet the behavioral health needs of all patients receiving medical treatment in primary care, including those who are more likely to experience barriers to specialty mental health care because of cost, language differences, stigma, and transportation difficulties [14]. Arguably one of the greatest benefits of this integrated model is strengthened communication between mental health providers (commonly referred to as behavioral health consultants) and medical care providers [14]. This enhanced communication facilitates unification of psychopharmacological and behavioral health interventions and maximizes opportunities for PCPs to receive treatment feedback, particularly with unique cases. Given the novelty and complexity of substance-induced psychiatric disorders, patients may benefit greatly from the high level of communication and coordination afforded by the PCBH model.In this case report, we describe a patient who took a single dose of MDMA that triggered substance-induced anxiety disorder which lasted for several months. The patient’s symptoms gradually improved and remitted with a combination of medical and behavioral therapy in a primary care office that had adopted principles of the PCBH model. The PCP and behavioral health consultant worked closely together and with the patient in providing comprehensive mental health care. This case report highlights both an uncommon presentation of substance-induced anxiety disorder and a unique approach to integrative mental health treatment.CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 35-year-old Hispanic man with a remote history of mild performance anxiety in late adolescence presented to our family medicine residency clinic to establish and seek care for acute onset of anxiety. The patient was a manager at a large manufacturing firm and had received a master’s degree. At the time of presentation, he was married with two children. He had no family history of mental illness and was not taking prescription medications. At his initial visit at the clinic, he reported that 9 days prior, he had taken one dose of “molly” while at a gathering with friends. The friend who had supplied the drug stated that it was “pure crystal MDMA.” According to the patient, this was his first lifetime use of MDMA. He had also consumed several alcoholic drinks that night, reportedly reaching the level of intoxication. He described having a “fine” experience with the drug and returned to his normal baseline for the next 2 days. On the third day after ingesting MDMA, he began to experience an increase in worry and agitation, he reported having panicked thoughts and development of palpitations, blurry vision, flushing, increased thirst, and insomnia. He stated that these symptoms increased over the coming days, prompting him to seek medical care. Regarding substance use history, the patient reported occasional social alcohol use since his early 20s, rarely to excess. He had used cannabis several times while in college (ages 18–22) and found that this precipitated anxiety and therefore he did not continue using it regularly. He denied any regular use of other illicit substances.On the initial day that the patient met with a medical provider in the clinic, he reported a score of 20 (maximum score of 21) on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale [15], an anxiety screening and rating tool commonly used in primary care offices. This score was consistent with a severe level of anxiety. The patient was prescribed buspirone, a serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A) receptor agonist, with a plan to uptitrate to 15 mg twice daily over the coming weeks. The patient was also referred to the clinic’s behavioral health service for adjunctive treatment and was promptly seen by a behavioral health consultant for their first session the following day. This initial visit involved an assessment of his biopsychosocial history and mood, a functional analysis of his anxiety symptoms, and a collaborative discussion regarding his treatment goals. Using interventions informed by cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient and the behavioral health consultant aimed to increase his coping skills and management of his anxiety symptoms and to improve his overall quality of life (e.g., reduce distress, increase enjoyment at home, and increase productivity at work).The patient was seen for follow-up every 7–10 days by his PCP for the next month (see Table 1). Simultaneously, he received behavioral health treatment each week following his first month of medical treatment in the family medicine clinic. He then established a therapeutic relationship with a counselor outside the clinic, where they reportedly engaged in talk therapy weekly. The patient reported only a slight improvement in his anxiety and panic symptoms despite the therapeutic dose buspirone, therefore, he was prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a benzodiazepine and was referred to the psychiatry department for additional consultation. The consulting psychiatrist was concerned for MDMA-induced anxiety disorder and recommended discontinuation of buspirone and initiation of low-dose sertraline with slow uptitration. The patient benefited from behavioral health treatment specifically aimed at enhancing understanding and controlling the sympathetic nervous system (i.e., cognitive behavioral modeling, psychoeducation on the cycle of panic, and relaxation skill training). Behavioral health treatment was especially important as he awaited the clinical effect of his psychoactive medications.Table 1                      Patient presentation and treatment timeline                    Day 0Patient reports having ingested MDMADay 3Development of acute anxiety and physiological arousalDay 9Patient presents to clinic for evaluation and is prescribed uptitration of buspironeWeek 2Patient is prescribed lorazepamWeek 3Patient is taking full dose of buspirone with no significant improvement in anxiety, rare lorazepam usePrescribed SSRI but does not start takingFirst visit with behavioral health consultant, total of six visits every 1–4 weeksWeek 4Seen by psychiatrist and given tentative diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety disorderSSRI recommendedWeek 6Begins SSRI sertraline and begins buspirone taperWeek 7Reports some improvement in anxiety and sleepWeek 7.5Reports acute worsening of anxiety with suicidal ideationSertraline dose is lowered, and in 3 days, patient no longer has suicidal ideation Weeks 8–10Continues sertraline, reaching dose of 50 mg once daily with continued improvement in anxietyWeeks 10+Seen by psychiatrist 2, who concurs with diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety disorderPatient continues sertraline 50 mg/day for several more months without resurgence of anxiety symptoms                    MDMA 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, SSRI Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitorOngoing evaluation by the PCP, a consulting psychiatrist, and the behavioral health consultant supported a diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety disorder. He experienced persistent anxiety (reporting daily worry, panic, racing heart, dizziness, restlessness, and catastrophic thinking), and all of his symptoms developed shortly after ingesting a single dose of MDMA. His symptoms caused him significant distress and impairment in his employment as well as his family life. The patient denied clinically significant anxiety directly prior to taking MDMA, his only history of anxiety was performance anxiety many years prior. Therefore, he did not meet criteria for panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, because his symptom onset followed substance ingestion. Simultaneously, the patient reported transdiagnostic depressive symptoms, including hopelessness, fatigue, maladaptive thinking, and low mood. These symptoms, which also began following the patient’s use of MDMA, were etiologically attributed to his anxious physiological symptoms and thoughts, in particular the catastrophic and generalized worries that this one-time drug use had “ruined” his life. Consequently, his symptoms appeared to be explained by the substance-induced anxiety, as opposed to representing a discrete depressive disorder.The patient initially tolerated the sertraline well and experienced a relatively rapid improvement in anxiety symptoms while taking 25 mg daily. After 8 days of the 25-mg dose, the dose was increased to 37.5 mg. After 2 days at this dose, the patient developed abrupt onset of suicidal ideation with a resurgence of anxiety and panic symptoms. Given the gravity of these new symptoms, the PCP and behavioral health consultant worked together and with the patient to devise a plan for ongoing care. He was able to see the behavioral health consultant for an urgent visit. The dose of sertraline was reduced to 25 mg, and plans were made for intensive outpatient mental health treatment at a nearby hospital.While awaiting entrance into that program, his suicidal ideation and anxiety abated. As his symptoms improved, the behavioral health consultant supplemented sympathetic nervous system training with thought identification and cognitive retraining. These interventions served to address his reported catastrophic and demoralizing appraisals following the use of MDMA (e.g., “I am a terrible person for taking that Molly,” and “I have ruined my life forever”). He saw a second psychiatrist for additional recommendations. They concurred with the diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety disorder and the prescribed SSRI treatment. Eventually, the dose of sertraline was slowly increased to 50 mg with continued improvement in all symptoms and no further resurgence of suicidal ideation. The patient’s anxiety and panic were not well controlled until approximately 2.5 months after ingesting MDMA. At 6 months following his presentation, he was doing well with a plan to slowly taper the sertraline. He expressed gratitude for an interdisciplinary team approach and the unique benefits of skills training in tandem with psychopharmacological treatment.DISCUSSION: In our patient, a single dose of MDMA triggered anxiety that lasted nearly 2.5 months and eventually improved with the implementation of both psychopharmacological and behavioral health techniques. We know of only one other case report in which one dose of MDMA was reported to precipitate protracted anxiety and/or panic symptoms [5], though given the general underreporting of illicit substance use, the true number may be higher. Clinicians should consider recent MDMA use as a potential etiology of acute anxiety.Substance-induced mental health disorders are challenging not only to diagnose but also to treat, particularly given the complex nature of substance interactions and overall patient presentation. In our patient, the diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety disorder was corroborated by three separate practitioners (a behavioral health consultant and two independent psychiatrists). The patient had denied any significant precipitants that may have triggered his anxiety, and there was a consistent temporal relationship between MDMA ingestion and his symptoms. Although the treating providers had no reason to doubt the patient’s stated history of one-time MDMA use, it is possible that he unknowingly had ingested other or additional substances. The treating providers did not employ a urine drug screen during the course of the patient’s evaluation and treatment, chiefly because few substances can be reliably detected 9 days postingestion. Therefore, the patient’s MDMA use must be taken at face value as the cause of his symptoms.Medically speaking, initial treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist buspirone was not effective in relieving the patient’s anxiety and should have been reserved as an adjunctive treatment to an SSRI-based treatment regimen, not as sole therapy. Offering a benzodiazepine at the first visit may have helped the patient more quickly gain control of his anxiety (it was not prescribed until the second visit), though benzodiazepines can interfere with cognitive behavioral therapy and should be deployed with caution owing to concerns surrounding dependence and abuse. It was not until uptitration of the SSRI sertraline that the patient began to experience consistent symptomatic improvement. Notably, this patient did experience a brief worsening of his anxiety while initiating sertraline, this is a relatively common and well-known side effect of SSRIs. In this case, the patient’s acute worsening of symptoms lasted only a few days. Many psychotropic therapies take weeks to months to take effect, and a key component of the patient’s care was timely access to mental health care that served to alleviate symptoms while awaiting the therapeutic effect of medications.The PCBH model served to offer collaborative, interdisciplinary care that treated both his short-term and long-term needs. The patient’s acute needs were met by psychopharmacological treatment aimed at reducing his debilitating physiological panic and anxiety symptoms. The providers were able to offer long-term benefits by tailoring a behavioral health treatment plan that helped the patient modify newly exacerbated maladaptive thought patterns (cognitive retraining) as well as develop long-term behavioral skills to manage his physiological symptoms (relaxation training).His overall treatment was bolstered by adherence to the PCBH model’s recommendation of frequent, efficient, and consistent communication between multidisciplinary team members [14]. Use of this approach prevented delays in the patient’s treatment and enhanced treatment plan development and agreement among team members. The PCBH model has been found to be effective for treating patients across the entire spectrum of mental health conditions [10]. The present case report corroborates such findings and demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of integrating behavioral and primary medical care [14]. The PCBH model offers the advantage of combining the resources and knowledge of multiple providers in a single, unified, and accessible setting.CONCLUSION:This report describes a rare presentation of substance-induced anxiety disorder after ingestion of a single dose of MDMA. The patient’s symptoms were severe and were addressed with a combination of behavioral health and psychopharmacological therapies. His symptoms stabilized and improved only after several months of behavioral health counseling and medical treatment with the SSRI sertraline. We posit that his care was augmented by the direct integration of his medical treatment with his behavioral health treatment according to the PCBH model. This integration allowed for timely communication between the patient’s behavioral health provider and PCP and facilitated the assessment and treatment of his unique mental health disorder.;
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-016-0957-9;Airway management in a patient with nuchal, interspinous, and flavum ligament rupture by a sickle: a case report;;;INTRODUCTION: Penetrating neck injury is an important trauma subset but is relatively rare, especially when involving the posterior cervical column. Rupture of the neck restraints, including the interspinous and flavum ligaments, can create serious cervical instability that requires special consideration when managing the airway. However, no detailed information regarding airway management in patients with profound posterior neck muscle laceration and direct cervical ligament disruption by an edged weapon is yet available in the literature.CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old Japanese man attempted to cut off his head using a sickle after drinking a copious amount of alcohol. On admission, his posterior vertebral column was grossly exposed and the lacerated tissues were actively bleeding, resulting in severe hypovolemic shock. We used a rapid-sequence intubation technique with direct laryngoscopy while manual in-line stabilization of his head and neck was maintained by several people. Surgical exploration revealed nuchal, interspinous, and flavum ligament rupture between his fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae, but no injury to the great vessels was present. The major source of bleeding was a site of oozing from his trapezius and splenius muscles. After surgical hemostasis, wound repair, and subsequent intensive care, our patient was discharged home without any neurological sequelae.CONCLUSION: Deficits of the neck restraints can cause cervical spine subluxation and dislocation secondary to neck movement. Thus, the key to successful airway management in such a scenario is minimization of neck movement to prevent further neurological impairment. We successfully managed an airway using a conventional but trusted endotracheal intubation strategy in a patient with multiple traumas and a suspected spinal cord injury. This case also illustrates that, even when great vessel injury is absent, severe hypovolemic shock may occur after profound neck muscle laceration, requiring immediate surgical intervention.;INTRODUCTION: The neck contains vital organs, including large vessels, the trachea, and nerves, within a confined space. A penetrating neck injury (PNI) can directly jeopardize airway patency, oxygenation, and the circulatory status. Definitive airway management and surgical hemostasis are key lifesaving treatments in this important trauma subset.PNI is not commonly seen in developed countries, especially a PNI involving the posterior neck [1–3]. Cervical musculoligamentous structures, including the nuchal, interspinous, and flavum ligaments, play a significant role in maintaining spine stability [4–6]. Deficits of these restraints can cause cervical spine subluxation and dislocation secondary to neck movement [4–6], requiring special anesthetic consideration. To the best of our knowledge, however, no detailed information regarding airway management in patients with direct cervical ligament rupture by an edged weapon is available in the literature. Therefore, we present our experience with a case of self-inflicted profound posterior neck muscle laceration involving nuchal, interspinous, and flavum ligament disruption.CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old Japanese man attempted to cut off his head with a rusty sickle immediately after drinking a copious amount of alcohol. On admission to our emergency department (ED), he was in the supine position and manually immobilized by several paramedics. A physical examination revealed gross exposure of his posterior vertebral column and active bleeding from lacerated tissues (Fig. 1a, b, image obtained in the operating room). Manual pressure hemostasis was provided but was unsuccessful, and our patient developed serious hypovolemic shock. His initial vital signs recorded in our ED were as follows: body temperature, 34.0 °C, heart rate, 140 beats/min, blood pressure, not measurable (the femoral artery was faintly palpable but the radial artery was not), and respiratory rate, 30 breaths/min. He was restless, and his conscious level was 9 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (E2V2M5). His extremities were cool and wet, but no trauma was evident. Our patient was in obvious distress, preventing us from performing a detailed neurological examination. His breath smelled of alcohol. He was lean and did not have a short neck or micrognathia, he showed no signs of restricted mouth opening. The remainder of the physical examination, including assessment of his thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, was normal. He had no history of medication or allergies.                                      Fig. 1                      Self-inflicted penetrating posterior cervical column injury by a sickle. The posterior vertebral column was grossly exposed, and the lacerated soft tissues bled actively. a Lateral view and b craniad viewThe need for immediate definitive airway management and surgical hemostasis was apparent. While several people maintained manual in-line stabilization and pressure hemostasis of his head and neck, anesthesia was induced in our ED. Alternative ventilation and intubation equipment, including a supraglottic airway device, video laryngoscope, and surgical airway device, was set up, and we performed rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) with intravenously administered fentanyl (1 μg/kg), ketamine (1 mg/kg), and rocuronium (1 mg/kg) using a conventional laryngoscope. Direct laryngoscopy provided a Cormack–Lehane grade 1 view and revealed neither airway distortion nor edema. An endotracheal tube (inner diameter, 7.0 mm) passed his vocal cords easily. Computed tomography revealed air in his spinal canal, suggesting that the dura mater was perforated (Fig. 2).                                      Fig. 2                      Computed tomography scan showing air in the spinal canal. The black circle indicates air in the spinal canal, suggesting dura mater perforationSurgical exploration revealed laceration of the interspinous and flavum ligaments between his fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae, and the dura mater was exposed (Fig. 3). Fortunately, neither major cerebrospinal fluid leakage nor vertebral artery injury was present. Therefore, surgical repair of the dura mater and large vessels was not required. The major source of bleeding was oozing from lacerations of the trapezius and splenius muscles of his neck, bleeding from both sites was surgically controlled. The facet joints were also intact, which convinced us that cervical stability could be ensured if wound repair and external fixation were provided. After copious irrigation, fascia and soft tissue repair, and cervical collar installation, our patient was admitted to our intensive care unit where he was maintained on controlled ventilation. An examination using a flexible fiberscope the following day revealed neither airway distortion nor edema, allowing successful extubation. His vocal cord movement was also normal. A neurological examination revealed no deficits. He was treated with intravenously administered cefazolin for 3 days to prevent surgical site infection. On day 5, he was transferred to our psychiatric department. The cervical collar was removed on day 14. After further psychiatric evaluation and treatment, he was discharged home and returned to normal activity. At his outpatient follow-up appointment 6 months later, he was neurologically intact and had no neck deformity, including kyphosis or torticollis.                                      Fig. 3                      Operative findings. The nuchal, interspinous, and flavum ligaments between the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae were ruptured. Major cerebrospinal fluid leakage and vertebral artery injury were absent. The white arrow indicates the perforated flavum ligamentDISCUSSION: We have herein reported our airway and surgical management experiences in a case of devastating soft tissue disruption of the posterior neck. Direct rupture of neck restraints, including the nuchal, interspinous, and flavum ligaments, leads to severe spinal instability [4–6]. Therefore, the key to airway management is to minimize movement of the cervical spine. This case also illustrates that PNI of the posterior cervical neck requires immediate surgical treatment even when great vessel injury is absent.This case illustrates the considerations required when managing the airway of patients with disrupted posterior neck restraints. According to the porcine trauma model described by Oxland et al. [4], complete injury to both the interspinous and flavum ligaments increases flexion motion by 180 %. Using human cadaver models, Richter et al. [5] also showed that interspinous and flavum ligament injury increases spinal instability in flexion/extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending. Thus, all neck movements, especially flexion, must be avoided when managing an airway. A variety of different endotracheal intubation (ETI) methods has been used to attain this purpose. Direct laryngoscopy with manual in-line cervical immobilization is a traditional ETI strategy in patients with multiple traumas who are at risk for or have spinal cord injury [7, 8]. We used this conventional, trusted technique and achieved a satisfactory outcome. Another attractive choice is ETI using video laryngoscopy. At least in planned anesthesia, video laryngoscopy can reduce the movement of the cervical spine during ETI compared with conventional laryngoscopy [9–11]. Use of a bougie as an aid during video laryngoscopy may further reduce movement [11]. The anesthesiology literature also reveals that video laryngoscopy can offer a better glottic view than conventional laryngoscopy in patients with limited neck movement [12]. Nevertheless, whether video laryngoscopy can reduce neck movement in the emergency setting has not been elucidated [9–11], whether it is more successful in trauma subsets of patients is also unclear [12]. Nasotracheal intubation is also known to decrease motion of the spinal segments compared with oral intubation [13], and fiber-optic intubation has been considered the gold standard technique with which to manage patients with restricted neck movement in planned anesthesia. However, nasotracheal intubation is less successful when used in the emergency setting [1] and can cause serious complications, including nasopharyngeal bleeding and retropharyngeal perforation [8]. Fiber-optic intubation is sometimes time-consuming, and the technique requires extensive training [7]. It is well known that fiber-optic intubation has a high failure rate when this technique is used in the ED [14]. Valero et al. [7] successfully used a laryngeal mask to manage a patient with a drill bit penetrating his spinal canal. They insisted that use of a laryngeal mask was highly effective in minimizing cervical spine movement and providing adequate ventilation during the operation. Because our patient had drunk alcohol immediately before his suicide attempt, we could not apply this technique in the present case.The use of RSI is controversial for airway management in patients with PNI [1–3] because such patients likely have an edematous and/or distorted airway, making both manual ventilation and ETI difficult. Therefore, we adequately prepared back-up ventilation and an intubation strategy before induction of anesthesia. However, at least in our case, there was no airway deformity and RSI was highly effective in facilitating safe ETI. The cough reflex may have abolished the cervical spine stability, and the cardiovascular response associated with ETI might have increased bleeding from the deeply lacerated posterior neck muscle. In this case, RSI successfully prevented both of these important adverse events and provided a satisfactory intubation condition. Logically thinking, PNI of the posterior neck is less likely to cause upper airway edema. Thus, RSI may be the most reasonable approach in patients with a penetrating posterior cervical injury.This case also illustrates that deep laceration of the posterior cervical column can result in profound hypovolemic shock, even when great vessel injury is absent. The blood supply to the posterior cervical muscle is very rich, and manual hemostatic pressure may not be sufficient, as seen in this case. Therefore, immediate surgical intervention is vital in patients with profound posterior PNI.CONCLUSION:We have reported our airway management experience in a case of direct nuchal, interspinous, and flavum ligament rupture by a sickle. Regardless of the technique used, achieving maximal stability of the cervical spine is vitally important in such a scenario because neck movement secondary to ETI can result in cervical spine dislocation and further neurological deficits. We successfully managed an airway using direct laryngoscopy with manual in-line cervical immobilization by several people, which is a trusted strategy of ETI in patients with multiple traumas who have an established or suspected spinal cord injury. Even when great vessel injury is absent, surgical intervention must be initiated as soon as possible in patients with profound posterior PNI because the blood supply to the posterior cervical muscle is very rich and manual hemostatic pressure may not be sufficient.;
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-015-0611-y;Extreme hypernatremic dehydration due to potential sodium intoxication: consequences and management for an infant with diarrhea at an urban intensive care unit in Bangladesh: a case report;;ECS: Extracellular space, EEG: Electroencephalography, ICU: Intensive care unit, IV: Intravenous, LSW: Longer-stay ward, MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging, ORS: Oral rehydration salt, RME: Routine microscopic examination;INTRODUCTION: Hypernatremia (serum sodium ≥150mmol/L) is one of the most life-threatening complications of childhood diarrhea, and its management remains challenging, even in a highly advanced critical care setting. This case report describes the acute clinical course and 3-month neurological follow-up after discharge of an infant with extreme hypernatremia in an intensive care unit in Dhaka, Bangladesh.CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-month-old Asian Bangladeshi girl of middle-class socioeconomic status was admitted to the intensive care unit of our institution in 2012 with acute watery diarrhea, lethargy and hypernatremia (208mmol/L serum sodium). She had a history of taking excess oral rehydration salt: five packets each, inappropriately prepared, rice-based, properly diluted, glucose-based oral rehydration salt. Her hypernatremia was treated exclusively with oral rehydration salt solution. She experienced seizures on the third day of her hospitalization and was treated with anticonvulsant drugs. Later in the course of her hospitalization, Enterobacter spp bacteremia was detected and successfully treated with ciprofloxacin. Although magnetic resonance imaging of her brain at discharge showed cerebral edema, brain magnetic resonance imaging appeared normal at a follow-up examination 3 months after discharge. Electroencephalograms taken at discharge and at her 3-month follow-up examination also appeared normal.CONCLUSION: Successful management of extreme hypernatremia with only oral rehydration salt did not result in observable neurological consequences, which emphasizes the importance of the use of oral rehydration salt for the clinical management of childhood hypernatremia.;INTRODUCTION: Serum sodium is a key component of extracellular fluid, which regulates water balance to maintain homeostasis [1]. However, excess serum sodium, or hypernatremia (≥150mmol/L) [1], is often associated with life-threatening neurological deficits caused by the hyperosmolar effect of hypernatremia itself. Inappropriate correction of hypernatremia with a rapid fall of serum sodium is also associated with a high fatality rate [2]. Common life-threatening conditions are hemorrhage, thrombosis, subdural effusion from hypernatremia and cerebral edema caused by a rapid decrease in serum sodium [3]. Improperly prepared oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution, such as preparation with incorrect proportions [4], and intake frequency have often been reported to cause different degrees of severity of hypernatremia [5,6]. Childhood diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection often presents with watery stools, which is associated with the body’s conservation of sodium loss via stools [7,8]. Consumption of appropriately prepared ORS in rotavirus-caused diarrhea may still result in a hyperosmolar condition [9,10]. Children become excessively thirsty, which often results in caregivers’ frequently administering ORS to quench thirst and ultimately leads to severe and extreme hypernatremia [5,6].Dhaka Hospital is the largest diarrheal disease hospital in Bangladesh. It is the only referral hospital in Bangladesh for diarrheal disease management and related complications, especially electrolyte imbalances. The hospital receives more than 140,000 patients with diarrhea annually, among whom 60% are children under the age of 5 years [11]. Very recently, a child younger than 5 years of age was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital with diarrhea and 208mmol/L serum sodium. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of a child with such an extreme level of serum sodium corrected by simple administration of ORS [12].CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-month-old Asian Bangladeshi girl was brought to our hospital in 2012. She was the third-born child of her non-consanguineous parents and had been delivered normally at home. She was exclusively breast-fed from birth to 2 months of age and then received diluted formula with breast milk. She had received immunizations as per the national Expanded Program on Immunization schedule and did not have any unusual previous illnesses. Her developmental milestones were age-appropriate. Her father was a petty businessman, and her mother was a housewife. The family’s household monthly income was $150 to $200, which is considered middle-class in Bangladesh.At triage, the initial reported symptoms were acute watery diarrhea with no sign of dehydration, however, as the baby appeared abnormally ill to the attending nurse, she was transferred to the longer-stay ward (LSW). Shortly thereafter (within 2.5 hours), she was relocated to the ICU by the attending physician in the LSW for management of extreme lethargy. In the ICU, her mother reported her child had experienced passage of moderate volumes of watery stool for the previous 2 days, fever for the same duration and lethargy for the past 12 hours. Her bowel movement frequency was 12 to 15 times per day. The stools did not contain visible blood or mucus. Her axillary temperature was 39.4°C. No vomiting, rash or convulsions were observed. For the child’s issues, the mother initially consulted a physician at a nearby community clinic and was advised to provide ORS solution and paracetamol. The parents did not receive any demonstration of appropriate ORS preparation. As the child had received inappropriate treatment, she became restless, extremely thirsty and lethargic, which prompted the mother to bring her child to the Dhaka Hospital of the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research. Further inquiry of the mother in the ICU revealed that her baby had received excess amount of ORS instead of her routine diet, as the child had excessive thirst. The child received less than one-half of her normal diet, 5 packets of rice-based ORS inappropriately prepared (1 packet of rice powder dissolved and boiled in 500ml of water, instead of 1100ml of water) and 5 packets of properly diluted, glucose-based ORS prior to admission. The child passed urine a few hours prior to admission.The patient’s physical examination revealed that she was lethargic and irritable upon touch. Her axillary temperature was 39.4°C, her pulse rate was 134 per minute with normal volume, her blood pressure was 100/50mmHg, her capillary refilling time was 3 seconds and her respiratory rate was 54 breaths per minute. She weighed 5.9kg and had a recumbent length of 63cm. According to her anthropometrics, her Z-scores for weight for age, weight for length and length for age were −1.29, −0.40 and −1.21, respectively. She did not present with any pallor or signs of dehydration, edema or cyanosis. Although she was mildly tachypneic, other related clinical signs were normal (breathing, heart sounds), and there was no observable lower chest wall indrawing or adventitious sounds in lungs. Her abdomen was soft, not distended and not tender, and her bowel sounds were active. Her blood glucose was 11.9mmol/L (measured at bedside), and her arterial oxygen saturation was 99% in room air.On the basis of our patient’s history and physical examination, we determined that her initial problems were acute watery diarrhea, lethargy with excessive thirst and sepsis. On the basis of her lethargy and excessive thirst, our differential diagnoses were hypernatremia and encephalopathy.The results of our initial investigations are given in Table 1. The chest X-ray, stool routine microscopic examination (RME) and urine RME revealed normal findings. Her blood culture showed growth of Enterobacter spp, but a rectal swab culture showed no growth of any organism.Table 1                                              Initial assessment at hospital admission (day 1)                                          IndicatorsResultsHemoglobin9.9g/dlTotal white blood cells8,900/mm3 bloodNeutrophils44.5%Lymphocytes42.0%Total calcium1.86mmol/LTotal magnesium1.22mmol/LSerum creatinine47μmol/LInitially, the child was treated with intravenous (IV) ampicillin and gentamicin for probable sepsis. Within a few hours of admission, her serum electrolyte report became available, which revealed extreme hypernatremia (208mmol/L) and hypocalcemia (1.86mmol/L). Correction of hypernatremic dehydration was achieved by administering ORS via a nasogastric tube, owing to lack of an absolute indication for IV fluid for this child. The required volume was calculated by using the formula [10 ÷ (molecular concentration of sodium in a given solution − measured serum sodium)/(0.6 × weight in kilograms + 1) = liters/24 hours], with the goal of not reducing serum sodium by >10mmol/L over the course of 24 hours (Table 1). Her ongoing serum sodium loss with each purging was also adjusted by ORS administration as required. Her hypocalcemia was corrected by administering a single bolus of IV calcium gluconate (0.5ml/kg after dissolving with the same volume of normal saline) over 10 minutes, followed by oral calcium supplementation. However, her fever remained unresponsive. Her blood culture (sampled on day 1 of admission and confirmed by report on day 3) showed growth of Enterobacter spp that were resistant to some antibiotics but sensitive to co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem. Thus, at approximately 96 hours of our patient’s admission, her antimicrobial therapy was changed to IV ciprofloxacin on the basis of clinical unresponsiveness and an antibiogram.After approximately 24 hours of hospitalization, our patient’s serum sodium level was 174mmol/L and decreasing at a rate of >0.5mmol/L/hr. The correction was readjusted after we recalculated the volume of ORS. The ORS regimen and subsequent serum sodium levels are presented in Table 2. To prevent further decline of her serum sodium level, we added salt to her diet (1g/L). On day 3 (approximately 63 hours after admission), she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The seizure was difficult to control and required two doses of IV lorazepam (0.1mg/kg/dose, 10 minutes apart), followed by a loading dose of IV phenobarbitone (20mg/kg) and IV phenytoin (20mg/kg). Simultaneously, maintenance doses of phenobarbitone and phenytoin were administered to prevent further attacks of convulsion. After cessation of convulsion, we reevaluated the patient and found no signs of meningisms. Her fundoscopic examination revealed no signs of cerebral hemorrhage or edema. Around 72 hours after her hospital admission, her serum sodium concentration had returned to a normal level (145.8mmol/L). As she experienced no further convulsions, anticonvulsants were gradually tapered over a period of 7 days, following a seizure-free period of nearly 48 hours, with phenytoin followed by phenobarbitone. Simultaneously, her general condition gradually improved, and her diarrhea resolved by day 6. She became alert and responsive with no apparent neurological deficits, and she was discharged to home on day 12.Table 2                                              Patient’s clinical course and laboratory investigations                                           Day of admission Day 1Day 2Day 3Day 4Weight (g)5900610067006800G-ORSa (ml/hr)14.52025–Serum sodium (mmol/L)208.2174160.3145.8Serum potassium (mmol/L)3.954.54.884.83                            Serum chloride (mmol/L)                                                      166.2                                                      144.1                                                      131.3                                                      119.8                                                      Serum bicarbonate (mmol/L)                                                      26.4                                                      22.2                                                      20.8                                                      15.3                                                      pH                                                      7.46                                                      –                                                      –                                                      –                          Glucose (mmol/L)    12:00 am11.915.00––7.00 am10.36.504.80–12.00 pm11.34.00––                    aG-ORS, Glucose-based oral rehydration salt.To look for any neurological complications associated with hypernatremia, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed before discharge. The EEG findings revealed a focal slowing that was restricted to the left posterior temporal and occipital regions. MRI showed edema in the internal capsule, thalamus and parieto-occipital cortex of both cerebral hemispheres (Figure 1). Follow-up EEG and MRI (Figure 1) performed 3 months after discharge appeared normal, with complete resolution of edema.

Images show the acute changes due to hypernatremia at hospital discharge and 3-month follow-up.DISCUSSION: A recent published case report described a patient with hypernatremia with a serum sodium level of 201mmol/L [13], including the patient’s clinical course and management by simple adjustment of ORS solution. Our patient was a child who was admitted to the hospital with a serum sodium level of 208mmol/L, which is the highest level of serum sodium concentration ever reported in Bangladesh. This is the second case involving a patient with serum sodium over 200mmol/L who was successfully managed exclusively with ORS solution [13]. This supports the effectiveness of ORS in correcting hypernatremic dehydration among children [13]. The findings also suggest that hypernatremic dehydration can be treated with ORS following the previous formula, although the ideal decline of serum sodium (0.5mmol/L/hr) might not always be possible [14].To prevent cerebral edema and convulsion, individuals with hypernatremia should be managed in such a way that the reduction rate of serum sodium occurs at approximately 10 to 12mmol/L/24 hr [15,16]. However, for individuals who develop hypernatremia because of acute salt poisoning rapid correction (1.0mmol/L/hr) within a few hours is also recommended for them to extrude the sodium from the brain to prevent convulsion [14]. As described above, our patient had consumed a large volume of ORS within a very short period and consequently developed hypernatremia acutely. Even after being given careful fluid management for 24 hours, her sodium level was decreased sharply at 34mmol/L. Her development of convulsions on day 3 was difficult to explain. Potential explanations include that the rapid decrease of sodium resulted in cerebral edema, which was confirmed by MRI and EEG at discharge, although fundoscopy showed normal findings during hospitalization. This rapid decline may have contributed to the development of convulsions. Although cerebral edema is ideally managed with 3% NaCl, we could not 0use the hypertonic solution because of a lack of clinical evidence of cerebral edema during our patient’s hospitalization, and therefore her convulsions were managed by the administration of anticonvulsive agents and subsequent supportive dietary management. Thus, performance of neuroimaging during management of seizures may be more helpful. In the case of our patient, a potential cause of her hypernatremia was her consumption of an excess volume of concentrated ORS within a very short period and continuation of only ORS replacing her normal diet to alleviate excessive thirst, which may have contributed to the development of sodium intoxication, resulting in extreme hypernatremia. Disproportionate fecal loss and simultaneous consumption of sodium via the ORS solution led to hyperosmolality in the extracellular space (ECS). The shifting of water from the intracellular space to the ECS resulted in intracellular dehydration and excess thirst [17,18]. Thus, it is important to promote judicious use of ORS in managing hypernatremic dehydration in the absence of an indication for IV correction, such as in patients with severe dehydration or shock, and simultaneously to educate caregivers about the consequences of excess intake and inappropriate preparation of ORS.There are other potential contributing factors to our patient’s development of extreme hypernatremia. As December is the winter season in Bangladesh, our patient may have had an increased insensible loss of water due to lower humidity. Moreover, she presented with fever, which might have caused excess insensible loss of water. Thus, even with appropriate use of ORS at home during the acute phase management of diarrhea in winter, a patient may develop hypernatremia [9,10], as in the present case.The initial MRI scan at discharge showed features of cerebral edema potentially resulting from the sharp reduction of serum sodium level within 24 hours, despite careful and very slow correction of dehydration with ORS. However, MRI performed at the 3-month follow-up visit revealed normal findings, which support the fact that adherence to use of ORS solution in managing hypernatremic dehydration helps to ultimately resolve cerebral edema after 3 months of normalization of serum sodium.CONCLUSION:Successful correction of extreme hypernatremia (208mmol/L) with scrupulous adherence to the use of simple ORS solution without any long-term neurological consequences in a young infant may be possible. However, further evaluation in randomized controlled clinical trials on management of hypernatremia with the administration of ORS compared to IV fluid is imperative to accept or refute our observation.;

Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed C6 vertebral osteomyelitis, demonstrated by vertebral body destruction, cervical spine instability, prevertebral abscess, and spinal cord compression. She underwent C6 anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion, with fungal cultures confirming Blastomyces dermatitidis.CONCLUSION: Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion successful debrided, decompressed, and restored cervical spine stability in a patient with vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. The patient was subsequently treated with a 1-year course of itraconazole and had no recurrence of infection 4 years postoperatively.;INTRODUCTION: Blastomyces dermatitidis is a thermally dimorphic fungus endemic to North America [1]. The most common primary site of infection associated with B. dermatitidis is pneumonia with extrapulmonary dissemination occurring in 25 to 50 % of diagnosed cases, usually via the lymphohematogenous route [1, 2]. Osteomyelitis has been found in about 25 % of cases with extrapulmonary manifestations [3]. In 75 % of patients with osseous blastomycosis, pulmonary disease is also found at time of presentation [4]. We report a case of cervical spine osteomyelitis caused by B. dermatitidis resulting in C6 vertebral body destruction and subsequent cervical spine instability. The patient was successfully treated with anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) and itraconazole.CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old immunocompetent Hispanic woman sustained a mechanical fall after slipping on ice and hitting her chin on the ground. Two weeks after the injury, she began to develop neck pain that was not present immediately after the injury. She presented to an emergency department and X-rays of her cervical spine were obtained. The X-rays were found to be normal and she was discharged with pain medication. After another 2 weeks of persistent, non-improving neck pain, she returned to the emergency department of the referring hospital for evaluation. Cervical spine X-rays, cervical spine computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast, and a cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast were obtained. CT and MRI revealed a right-sided paraspinal soft tissue mass and an osteolytic lesion of the C6 vertebral body, causing a compression deformity. Given the imaging findings, she was admitted for further diagnostic testing to evaluate for possible malignancy.A chest X-ray and a chest CT scan with contrast performed during her hospitalization revealed a 3.6×1.5 cm mass in the middle lobe of her right lung. She additionally underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass in her neck and a CT-guided biopsy of the mass in the middle lobe of her right lung. The biopsy of her neck mass was negative for malignancy but revealed multinucleated histiocytes, neutrophils, and inflammatory cells. The specimen was sent for Gram stain, acid-fast bacilli (AFB)/fungal smear, and cultures: aerobic/anaerobic, fungal, and tuberculosis (TB), all of which were negative. The biopsy of the lung mass was deemed inadequate. The patient failed to follow-up in clinic for biopsy results and was lost to follow-up.Four weeks later, she returned to the referring hospital’s emergency department complaining of a week of fevers, sweats, neck pain, as well as an enlarging neck mass with purulent discharge from the biopsy site. Repeat CT of the cervical spine and MRI of the cervical spine with and without contrast were obtained. Imaging revealed C6 osteomyelitis with significant vertebral body destruction and possible C5 involvement. The imaging also showed a prevertebral abscess at the C6 level with posterior subligamentous extension into her spinal canal, causing mild posterior displacement and compression of her cervical spinal cord (Figs. 1, 2). No indication of infarction, hemorrhage, or myelomalacia was found in her cervical spinal cord. Because the infectious diseases consultation service at the referring hospital suspected either TB or a bacterial infection, she was empirically started on anti-TB medications (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime). While performing an incision and drainage of the prevertebral abscess, otolaryngology at the referring hospital discovered an abscess with a fistulous tract communicating to the C6 vertebral body. AFB smear, Gram stain, and cultures (aerobic/anaerobic, fungal, and TB) were taken intraoperatively. The patient was transferred to our tertiary institution for urgent surgical decompression the same day.

The views show C6 osteomyelitis with significant vertebral body destruction (arrow), vertebral abscess at C6 level with posterior subligamentous extension into the spinal canal including mild posterior displacement and compression of cervical spinal cordOn admission, she was afebrile, with a heart rate of 88/minute, a blood pressure of 132/88 mmHg, a pulse oximetry of 98 %, and a respiratory rate of 14/minute. Laboratory testing found a white blood cell count of 8.9 g/dL, a hemoglobin count of 11.9 g/dL, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 94 mm/hour. On examination, she had 5/5 strength in all muscle groups in her upper and lower extremities bilaterally. She had a positive Hoffman sign on the left side and hyperactive bicep and knee reflexes bilaterally. She denied any exposure to wooded/forested areas, however, she did report that she was living in her parent’s unfinished basement where significant construction had taken place including the concrete floor being dug up.She underwent emergency C6 ACCF to decompress her spinal cord and restore cervical spine stability. During the procedure, purulent material was expressed from under the prevertebral fascia and was sent for microscopy and aerobic/anaerobic bacterial cultures, fungal cultures, and mycobacterial cultures. Caspar posts were placed in the vertebral bodies of C4 and C7 and distraction was performed followed by exploration and decompression. The C6 vertebral body was found to be completely destroyed, however, the C5 body remained well preserved. After removing the infectious debris, remnants of the vertebral body, and C5 to C6 and C6 to C7 disk material, an 18 mm polyetheretherketone (PEEK) stackable cage (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) allograft (Synthes, West Chester, PA, USA) was placed into the C6 space. A 35 mm Atlantis Vision anterior cervical plate (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was secured into the bodies of C5 and C7 with four 12 mm screws (Fig. 3). No complications were encountered during the surgery and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.                                      Fig. 3                      Postoperative lateral cervical spine X-ray showing 18 mm polyetheretherketone cage and 35 mm anterior cervical plateThe histopathology was positive for budding yeasts consistent with Blastomyces species The anti-TB medications as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics were stopped. The infectious diseases consultation service recommended treating the patient’s osseous blastomycosis and presumed pulmonary blastomycosis with a loading phase of itraconazole 200 mg taken every 8 hours for 5 days followed by a yearlong course of itraconazole 200 mg twice daily. Urine antigen testing for Blastomyces species cultures (aerobic/anaerobic), AFB smear, TB QuantiFERON, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing were all found to be negative. Urine antigen testing for Histoplasma capsulatum was reported to be low positive. Fungal cultures obtained at the referring hospital and at our institution were positive for Blastomyces dermatitidis, confirming the histopathology findings. The infectious diseases consultation service ensured therapeutic levels were achieved by monitoring the patient’s serum levels during the year-long itraconazole course. A chest CT scan obtained 9 months postoperatively revealed resolution of the mass in the middle lobe of her right lung. At 17 months postoperatively, a cervical spine CT scan was obtained showing C5 to C7 fusion (Fig. 4). At 4 years postoperatively, she had no recurrence and remained pain free.                                      Fig. 4                      Postoperative computed tomography scan obtained at 17 months showing fusion of C5 to C7DISCUSSION: Blastomyces dermatitidis is endemic to the southern and southeastern states bordering the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys as well as Midwestern states and Canadian provinces that border the Great Lakes [1]. B. dermatitidis is endemic in wooded/forested areas around Chicago and the Great Lakes area. The patient lived in an urban environment and denied any recent exposure to wooded/forested areas. Lacking this type of exposure, we suspect that the moist soil exposed during the course of the basement construction, could possibly have been the source of the patient’s exposure. Osseous involvement is the third most common location for Blastomyces dermatitidis after lungs and skin, with ribs, long bones, skull, and vertebrae being the most common bones involved [1]. While vertebral osteomyelitis most commonly affects the lower thoracic and lumbar areas of the spine, a few reports of cervical, upper-thoracic, and sacral involvement have been previously reported [5]. We suspect that in our patient, undiagnosed pulmonary blastomycosis seeded the C6 vertebral body when the patient fell and injured her neck.Fungal infections of the spine are uncommon and relatively difficult to diagnose with an average delay of 3 months [5]. Delays in diagnosis and treatment are also associated with poorer outcomes [5]. Patients with vertebral blastomycosis often clinically present with constitutional symptoms, local bone destruction, and the formation of a contiguous abscess as was seen in our patient, however, these findings are nonspecific and can be seen in patients with TB and other fungal infections [5]. In patients with TB and other fungal infections, bony destruction often begins with the anterior vertebral body and then progresses more posteriorly, resulting in a wedge-shaped compression fracture [5]. We suspect that this pattern was not seen in our patient due to the patient’s late presentation and extensive vertebral body destruction. Other common radiographic findings include vertebral body collapse and disk-space narrowing, vertebral body collapse was seen in our patient (Fig. 1) [5]. In addition, patients frequently develop abscesses that track through the soft tissue with a visible subcutaneous mass [5].While there are many clinical and radiographic findings, none are pathognomonic for blastomycosis. Definitive diagnosis can only be made with the visualization of the characteristic broad-based budding yeast or growth of fungus in cultures. The fungal smear and culture on initial ultrasound-guided aspiration of neck mass was negative. We believe that the failure to isolate a causative fungal species at that time is most likely due to inadequate sampling, given both were negative [1]. Urine antigen testing has been reported to have sensitivity and specificity of 92.9 % and 79.3 % respectively for all forms of blastomycosis, pulmonary and disseminated [6]. In our patient, the Blastomyces urine antigen was negative and the Histoplasma urine antigen was low positive. Durkin et al. found that high cross-reactivity exists between mycoses because the epitope detected shares a common glycoprotein antigen [6]. This makes the test less valuable for differentiating between fungal species [6]. If urine antigen testing is available at one’s institution, it can help clinicians differentiate fungal infections from TB and guide early treatment until the causative species is definitively identified.Vertebral blastomycosis has been successfully treated nonoperatively with antifungal medications [1, 2, 7–9]. In patients with moderate to severe disseminated extrapulmonary blastomycosis or with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s clinical guidelines for the management of blastomycosis recommend the use of amphotericin-B lipid formulations until clinical stabilization and then a course of itraconazole [10]. The infectious diseases consultation service recommended using itraconazole in our patient because she lacked CNS involvement. Extended spectrum azoles, such as voriconazole and posaconazole, can also be utilized for treatment [10]. A growing number of case reports have documented successful treatment of patients with blastomycosis using voriconazole and posaconazole [10, 11]. Surgical decompression and stabilization should be reserved for those with neurological deficits, instability, and/or deformity, as was the case with our patient [1, 7, 8, 12, 13].Preoperatively, external fixation using a halo vest was considered until resolution of the active infection, at which point the patient would undergo definitive fixation. However, we believe that an ACCF with anterior instrumentation is not contraindicated in patients because B. dermatitidis lacks glycocalyx biofilm that might hinder eradication [8]. As a result, we conclude that the benefit of performing a single-staged procedure with debridement and definitive fixation outweighs the risks of a multi-staged procedure. The remnant infected C6 vertebral body was considered to be an inappropriate and inadequate source of cancellous autograft bone, thus DBM was chosen as a substitute for fusion purposes. While the C5 vertebra was found to be well preserved intraoperatively, there was still concern that it may have been compromised and be at increased risk for subsidence. The decision to use a PEEK cage was made for its biomechanical properties, namely its elastic modulus. The elastic modulus of PEEK cages matches cortical bone more closely than titanium mesh cages, which may reduce the risk of subsidence [14, 15].We report the successful treatment of a patient actively infected by B. dermatitidis, with concurrent cord compression and cervical spine instability by performing ACCF and treatment with itraconazole for 1 year. ACCF allowed for simultaneous debridement, decompression, and restoration of cervical spine stability. This treatment regimen resulted in the absence of clinical or radiologic evidence of disease at 4 years follow-up.CONCLUSION:Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.;

A pre-existing immune thrombocytopenic purpura is known to be a risk factor for developing thrombocytopenia during pregnancy. We present here the treatment regime and management of a patient with known immune thrombocytopenic purpura who developed postpartum thrombotic thrombocytopenia with atypical response to traditional therapy.Pregnant women are more vulnerable to immune thrombocytopenic purpura or thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Pregnancy or postpartum thrombotic thrombocytopenia accounts for 10–25% of all thrombotic thrombocytopenia.CASE PRESENTATION: This case report deals with the treatment regime and management of a patient with known immune thrombocytopenic purpura who developed postpartum thrombotic thrombocytopenia. A 30-year-old Middle Eastern woman, with a prior diagnosis of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura had remained off-the-treatment for many years. After primary unexplained infertility for 8 years, for which she underwent six failed trials of in vitro fertilization, she delivered a healthy baby through caesarean section. Two days post-surgery, she had persistent thrombocytopenia, ecchymoses, bruises, and hemolysis. Her blood film revealed leukoerythroblastic anemia. Her blood tests also revealed a very low level of haptoglobin, and low level of ADAMTS13. A diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenia was suspected. Plasma exchange therapy was started with partial response. We showed that rituximab in conjunction with mycophenolate mofetil following plasma exchange therapy was effective in controlling the low platelet count in our patient.CONCLUSION: Rituximab in conjunction with mycophenolate mofetil following plasma exchange therapy was effective in controlling the low platelet count in our patient. Only two doses of rituximab were sufficient to normalize our patient. We present here a case of safe and effective use of rituximab in pregnancy-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.;INTRODUCTION: The occurrence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or thrombotic thrombocytopenia (TTP) is greatly increased during pregnancy. Incidences of ITP occur in 1 in every 1000–10,000 pregnancies accounting for 3% of all thrombocytopenic pregnancies [1]. Pregnancy or postpartum-related TTP accounts for 10–25% of all TTP. A pre-existing ITP is known to be a risk factor for developing thrombocytopenia during pregnancy [2]. We present here the treatment regime and management of a patient with known ITP who developed postpartum TTP with atypical response to traditional therapy. The unusualness of this case was the onset of presentation (postpartum) and the bruises and ecchymosis which were the main clinical features. These features are not known to be associated with ITP and medical staff has to be very vigilant and careful with these cases.CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old married Middle Eastern woman, a housewife living in a big city in Jordan, with a prior diagnosis of chronic ITP remained off-the-treatment for many years. She was not known to have any other medical illness. There was no family history of ITP or TTP. She had never smoked tobacco, drunk alcohol, or used illicit drugs. She was investigated for other causes of thrombocytopenia including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) but, unfortunately, the laboratory-specific results were not available, however, our patient stated that they were negative. Initially she was prescribed a low dose of orally administered prednisolone but this was discontinued years ago. She remained asymptomatic with approximate whole blood platelet counts of 50 × 109/L. She had primary unexplained infertility for 8 years for which she underwent six failed trials of in vitro fertilization (IVF). She conceived spontaneously and remained asymptomatic with whole blood platelet counts > 50 × 109/L. At 26 weeks of gestation, she was diagnosed as having glucose intolerance and started on metformin 850 mg twice daily. At 30 weeks of gestation, her whole blood platelet count was 30 × 109/L and she was still asymptomatic. She was started on 15 mg orally administered prednisolone. One week later, her whole blood platelet count dropped to 28 × 109/L, her prednisolone dose was increased to 30 mg daily. She was screened for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody (ACA), and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (BTIIGLYI) antibody and the results were normal: partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 27 seconds, ACA-immunoglobulin G (IgG) < 14 GPL, ACA-IgM < 12 MPL, BTIIGLYI-IgM 16 U/mL, and BTIIGLYI-IgG 17 U/mL. Two weeks later, her whole blood platelet count was 56 × 109/L. Her prednisolone dose was tapered gradually down to 15 mg at 34 weeks of gestation. At 35 weeks, her whole blood platelet count was 45 × 109/L, her blood hemoglobin (Hb) level was 125 g/L with an A-positive blood group, and she was asymptomatic with normal blood pressure (BP) and urine analysis.By 36 weeks of gestation, she presented with ruptured membranes, with no uterine contractions. Her BP, oral temperature, and pulse rate were 120/70 mmHg, 37.1 degrees Celsius and 90 beats/minute, respectively. Her general examination was unremarkable. An obstetric examination revealed a cephalic presentation and a fundal height that was corresponding to a 36-week pregnancy. There were no skin lesions. Her neurological examination was normal with no focal neurological deficits. A cardiotocography (CTG) was performed and was normal. Her Hb, white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count were 130 g/L, 12 × 109/L, and 33 × 109/L, respectively. Her liver function tests were normal: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 3.0 ukat/L and bilirubin total 8 umol/L. She insisted on caesarean section delivery despite thorough counselling regarding the mode of delivery. She was given intravenously 500 mg of methylprednisolone and intramuscularly 1500 IU of anti-D immunoglobulin in an attempt to quickly raise her platelet count. Six hours later, an uncomplicated caesarean section was performed under spinal anesthesia (she refused to have a general anesthetic and requested a spinal anesthesia despite counselling regarding the risk of hematoma because of her low platelet count). A healthy baby was delivered weighing 2.3 kg with normal platelet count. No instance of bleeding was noted during the surgery. The operative blood loss was estimated to be around 1000 ml. Recovery after surgery was smooth. She was given low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (40 mg of enoxaparin sodium), subcutaneously 12 hours after operation.Postoperatively on day 1, she was doing well with stable vital signs and no abnormal vaginal bleeding. No incidence of bruises or ecchymosis around the wound or anywhere else was noted. Her platelet count, WBC, and Hb were 46 × 109/L, 18.35 × 109/L, and 96 g/L, respectively. She was started on 30 mg of orally administered prednisolone. On the second postoperative day, ecchymosis started to appear around the wound. Her BP and urine analysis were normal. She had a platelet count of 52 × 109/L. Although she was reassured about the safety of breast feeding, she was not happy to breast feed and she had no breast pain or engorgement. In the afternoon, the bruises and ecchymosis spread across her lower abdomen and down to her upper thighs. A hematologist was consulted who advised observation only.On the third postoperative day, the ecchymosis expanded bilaterally over her suprapubic area, vulval area, flanks, and thighs. She complained of occipital headache which was relieved by simple analgesia, there were no other neurological symptoms or signs. Her BP was normal. An abdominal ultrasound (U/S) scan revealed an empty uterus with no free fluid in her abdomen or pelvis and no evidence of presence of hematoma. Her whole blood Hb was 88 g/L, WBC was 12.89 × 109/L, and platelet count was 50 × 109/L. We suspected a hemolytic process so a liver function test, haptoglobin, and blood film were requested. These revealed total serum bilirubin 17.07 umol/L, direct serum bilirubin 5.97 umol/L, total serum protein 55.6 g/L, serum albumin 34.4 g/L, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 0.47 ukat/L, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 0.80 ukat/L, serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) 0.55 ukat/L, and serum LDH 21.1 ukat/L. Her serum haptoglobin level was low, 100 mg/L, with negative direct and indirect Coombs tests. Her urine was normal. Blood film showed normocytic red cell anemia, polychromasia, few schistocytes, one to two nucleated red blood cells (RBCs)/100 WBCs, neutrophilic leukocytosis, occasionally left shifted neutrophils, and thrombocytopenia with large forms. Three ampoules of iron sucrose complex were given intravenously over 3 hours and she was started on orally administered iron.Four days after surgery, she was doing well apart from recurrent attacks of headache. Her BP was normal and she had no focal neurological signs. Her serum vitamin B12 level, serum iron, serum folate level, serum ferritin level, plasma prothrombin time (PT), whole blood PTT, and plasma fibrinogen were normal. Her newborn’s platelet count was normal. Total as well as direct bilirubin and LDH were elevated: 26.4 umol/L, 7.2 umol/L, and 26.7 ukat/L, respectively. Five days after surgery, there were severe and extensive bruises as well as ecchymosis. No abnormal vaginal bleeding or epistaxis was seen. Orally administered mycophenolate mofetil 360 mg was started twice daily in addition to the daily 30 mg orally administered prednisolone she was already taking.On the sixth postoperative day, ecchymosis was seen all over her abdomen, flanks, thighs, legs, and low back area. Her Hb was 83 g/L, WBC 16.6 × 109/L, platelet count 50 × 109/L, and LDH 28.7 ukat/L, and she had normal total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, random serum glucose, sodium, potassium, urea, and creatinine. Urine analysis showed + 1 proteinuria, no sugar, one to two WBC/high power field (HPF), and 2–4 RBC/HPF. Indirect and direct Coombs tests were negative. Two ampoules of iron sucrose were administered intravenously in 2 hours. Prednisolone dose was increased to 1 mg/kg daily.Bruises and ecchymosis increased 1-week post-surgery. Blood film revealed leukoerythroblastic anemia, anisocytosis, nine nucleated red cells/100 WBC, 8% left shifted neutrophils, and thrombocytopenia with few large forms. Her LDH level was 28.4 ukat/L. Her platelet count was 56 × 109/L, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALT, AST, and urine analysis were normal. TTP was suspected, hence, ADAMTS13 test was requested. The result indicated 11%. The next day, her bruises and ecchymosis were extensive and spreading. She was doing well with no neurological symptoms and stable vital signs. Her urine was normal. Blood film revealed plenty of schistocytes. TTP was strongly suspected, she was given 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Eight hours after the FFP infusion, her platelet count was 76 × 109/L.Bruises decreased the day after FFP infusion. Plasmapheresis (a left femoral dialysis line was inserted under aseptic technique) was started. The first session was done with 10 units of FFP and 4 units of cryoprecipitate. Investigations showed normal Hb, WBC, platelet count, liver function tests, and urine. On the successive day, bruises and ecchymosis decreased. LDH was 15.8 ukat/L with normal creatinine, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALT, AST, GGT, PT, PTT, and fibrinogen level. A urine examination showed + 1 proteinuria. A second session of plasmapheresis was done. On the next day, her platelet count was 60 × 109/L and Hb was 99 g/L with normal liver and kidney functions. Her LDH was 13.7 ukat/L, with normal PT, PTT, and fibrinogen level. Blood film showed leukoerythroblastic anemia, anisocytosis, polychromasia, schistocytes, and spherocytes. A third session of plasmapheresis was done. Following FFP infusion and plasmapheresis, ADAMTS13 level was > 19%.On the 12th postoperative day, a fourth session of plasmapheresis was done. Her LDH was 10.8 ukat/L with normal kidney and liver functions. Her platelet count was 54 × 109/L.After the fifth session of plasmapheresis, LDH was 8.56 ukat/L. PT, PTT, and fibrinogen level were normal. Ecchymosis decreased substantially. Our patient was asking for discharge.The next day, her platelet count was 52 × 109/L, LDH was 13.4 ukat/L with normal liver and kidney functions. A sixth session of plasmapheresis was carried out. A urine examination showed + 1 proteinuria. During all these days, our patient was on 1 mg/kg orally administered prednisolone per day and 360 mg orally administered mycophenolate twice daily. Ecchymosis decreased further on the following day. She was given intravenously rituximab 500 mg in 5 hours. Her LDH level was 11.0 ukat/L, platelet count was 100 × 109/L, Hb 111 g/L, and WBC 7.92 × 109/L. She was discharged with a prescription for orally administered prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily and 360 mg of orally administered mycophenolate twice daily.One week later, she was given the second dose of rituximab as an out-patient. She continued to do well with no bleeding tendency and a platelet count swinging between 50 × 109/L and 60 × 109/L.At 4 weeks after surgery, her Hb, WBC, and platelet count were 128 g/L, 13.7 × 109/L, and 130 × 109/L, respectively. Her liver and kidney function tests were normal. Two weeks later, her platelet count was 80 × 109/L. After a further 2 weeks, she continued to receive the same mycophenolate dose but started to decrease her prednisolone dose until it was completely stopped 3 weeks later.Ten weeks after surgery, she became asymptomatic with a platelet count of 92 × 109/L. She was receiving only mycophenolate mofetil at a dose of 360 mg twice daily. She stopped mycophenolate mofetil and remained completely asymptomatic. Six months after delivery, she was asymptomatic with a platelet count of 85 × 109/L. One year after her delivery, she was doing well, asymptomatic, and her platelet count was 79 × 109/L. Table 1 refers to results of patient’s blood tests in a chronological order.Table 1                      Shows results of patient’s blood tests in a chronological order                    Days1234567891011121314Hb (g/L)96 88  83    99  111Platelets (×109/L)465250  5049   605452100WBC (×109/L)18.35 12.89  16.6       7.9Total bilirubin (umol/L)  17.0726.4          Direct bilirubin (umol/L)  5.977.2          Total protein (g/L)  55.6           Albumin (g/L)  34.4           ALT (ukat/L)  0.47           AST (ukat/L)  0.80           GGT (ukat/L)  0.55           LDH (ukat/L)  21.126.7 28.728.4  15.813.710.813.411.0Haptoglobin (mg/L)  100           Direct Coombs  Negative   Negative       Indirect Coombs  Negative   Negative       Serum glucose (mmol/L)     4.1        Serum creatinine (umol/L)     90                            ALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, GGT gamma glutamyltransferase, Hb hemoglobin, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, WBC white blood cellsDISCUSSION: This was a case of pregnancy-triggered TTP in a patient with chronic ITP. Moreover, she underwent a caesarean section under a spinal anesthetic with severe thrombocytopenia and did not experience hemorrhagic complications. It unusually presented in the immediate postpartum period and was not a typical TTP, it did not respond to the traditional management pathways.TTP is a rare life-threatening disease which requires rapid intervention. Pregnancy is a known trigger for thrombocytopenia. A previous history of ITP aggravates thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [2]. However, to date it is diagnosed by exclusion of other diseases due to lack of concrete biomarkers [3]. In this case report we present a case in which a chronic history of ITP which remained asymptomatic for years was precipitated as TTP after delivery. Further, we discuss the difficulties encountered in the diagnosis of TTP in the postpartum woman as well as the management of the patient.A corticosteroid, such as prednisolone, is the first line of therapy for ITP [4]. It increases the platelet count in 2–4 weeks. However, in our case, the intake of a high dose of orally administered prednisolone initially with doses tapering in the later part making a total of 4 weeks was ineffective in increasing our patient’s platelet count. Intravenous administration of anti-D with or without steroids increases the platelet count rapidly in patients with ITP [5]. It is suitable for Rhesus antigen D (RhD) positive patients who are not splenectomized as in our case. Baseline Hb has a significant impact on platelet response to anti-D in adults [5]. Anti-D is also known to cause hemolysis and this is more pronounced 1 day after its administration [5], this was not the scenario in our case. Similarly, methylprednisolone is more effective than prednisolone in increasing the platelets count in thrombocytopenia [6]. Administration of methylprednisolone and anti-D a few hours before delivery by caesarean section in our patient was effective in preventing excessive blood loss.However, except for thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which occur frequently (50–75%), other symptoms of TTP are either not present or vaguely observed. Therefore, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and absence of alternative etiology are sufficient to diagnose TTP [6, 7]. This allows physicians to diagnose TTP rapidly, which can be of lifesaving importance. Incidences of TTP are also increasingly associated with pregnancy [8]. TTP can commence at any time in pregnancy. In a study, out of 13 pregnancies complicated by thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), three patients had onset before mid-pregnancy, eight had onset during peripartum, and two several weeks postpartum [9]. In our case, thrombocytopenia was detected during the third trimester while TTP was symptomatologically evident (by ecchymosis) at second day after delivering the baby by caesarean section. In our case, even though thrombocytopenia was present during the third trimester of gestation, the hemolytic anemia precipitated on second postoperative day. With the exception of the recurrent attacks of headache and proteinuria, her renal function and nervous system were normal without any episodes of fever. Because TTP typically does not have a bleeding tendency, the possibility of a migrating subcutaneous hematoma after the caesarean section with spinal anesthesia, which could have been facilitated by the single dose of LMWH, was excluded by a normal U/S scan of her abdominal wall, abdominal cavity, and pelvis.Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 is the underlying cause for developing TTP [3]. In acquired TTP this is mediated by auto-antibodies against ADAMTS13. An ADAMTS13 value of < 10% is indicative of TTP. However, ADAMTS13 levels can also be lowered (but > 10%) in pregnancy, postpartum, and other non-TTP diseases such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation, liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, certain medications [3], preeclampsia, eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) [10, 11]. Moreover, interferences in the assay measuring ADAMTS13 can occur from a high concentration of von Willebrand factor (vWF), hyperlipidemia, hemolysis with plasma free Hb > 2 g/L, and hyperbilirubinemia, and cleavage by other proteases can even complicate identification of TTP [3]. Besides, recent plasma exchange or transfusion may falsely normalize ADAMTS13 levels, thus potentially masking the diagnosis of TTP. Therefore, TTP remains a challenge in clinical diagnosis. In our patient, ADAMTS13 activity was 11%. Although undetectable levels of the enzyme activity are diagnostic of inherited or acquired TTP, not all patients diagnosed as having TTP have severe protease deficiency, and it is therefore not recommended as an initial test for diagnosis. Therefore, based only on the ADAMTS13 level, a concrete diagnosis of TTP is difficult. The rise in the level of ADAMTS13 activity with plasma infusion and plasmapheresis was in support of a diagnosis of TTP. Moreover, support from other laboratory diagnoses is very necessary.Identifying the presence of hemolytic anemia and its underlying cause is of prime importance in diagnosing TTP. The presence of schistocytes, the fragmented RBCs injured by damaged endothelium, in blood film investigation is one of the strong indicators of hemolytic anemia [12, 13]. However, identifying it microscopically lacks standardization and is dependent on the evaluator. A threshold of 0.2–0.5% schistocytes is necessary before suspecting TTP. In our case the few schistocytes were observed on third day post-surgery which increased drastically in 5 days. Although hemolysis (fragmented RBCs) was indicative in our case the decrease in Hb in our patient was not drastic (Hb changed from 96 to 83 g/L in 1 week). However, schistocytes are not specific for TTP, but are also seen in healthy persons as well as in patients with preeclampsia, eclampsia, chronic renal failure, solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, diabetic microangiopathy, and SLE, as well as in patients with a prosthetic heart valve [14, 15]. Severe bleeding is a common cause for the appearance of nucleated RBCs in peripheral blood smears in addition to reticulocytosis, but our patient did not have any bleeding episode. Therefore, the laboratory findings which appeared important in the diagnosis of TTP were high LDH to AST ratio since an increased LDH-to-AST ratio is known to indicate TTP [16, 17]. High LDH levels along with elevated creatine kinase are observed after surgery including caesarean section and are not always conclusive for hemolysis. Usually a negative Coombs test shows that the reason for hemolysis is TTP while a positive Coombs test suggests an immune-mediated reason for hemolysis [18]. Other causes of secondary TTP like DIC or APS are unlikely in our case because our patient was screened negative for APS and she had no excessive bleeding or blood transfusion to indicate a possible DIC.Early diagnosis of TTP and management of its symptoms acutely with advanced techniques such as plasma exchange therapy (PEX) is necessary as delay in initiating PEX is known to cause adverse outcomes [3, 19]. Normally, two to three sessions of PEX are sufficient to stabilize the platelet count [3], however, in our case, our patient achieved only symptomatological (ecchymosis decreased) relief and her LDH began to decrease after administration of PEX. Her platelet count failed to reach normal levels while her Hb level was also within 99 g/L range. Administration of immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil as well as corticosteroid prednisolone along with PEX was ineffective in increasing her platelet count and Hb level. In a few cases of ITP and TTP, mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to increase the platelet count as well as Hb [20–22].Rituximab is known to be a safe and effective treatment for newly diagnosed TTP and ITP, it decreases the number of PEX required for achieving remission and lowers the risk for recurrence by approximately 80%. In addition, unresponsiveness to steroids in chronic ITP is relatively common and fast responses to rituximab can be seen. Diagnostic consideration, therefore, cannot depend on the response to these therapies since they are both used effectively in both ITP and TTP [23, 24]. However, a review of 231 pregnancies indicated that rituximab is able to cross the placental barrier and induce neonatal hematological abnormalities or malformations [25]. Contrarily, in a study by Scully et al., administration of rituximab in a woman with pregnancy-related TTP was found to be safe and effective [26]. Application of rituximab along with PEX or shortly after PEX requires a greater number of applications of the medication to be effective because rituximab is removed from the circulation by the PEX [27]. Intravenous supply of rituximab, following PEX, not only rapidly increased the platelet count and Hb in our patient but also controlled her WBC count, which was slightly elevated, and normalized her LDH level. Our treatment regime of first performing multiple PEX to remove the inhibitors of ADAMTS13 and then applying rituximab was more effective and rapid. After a second dose of rituximab our patient was completely normal with normal platelet counts. PEX may have actually worked to correct the hemolysis but not the thrombocytopenia because she has an underlying ITP and ITP does not respond to PEX (this might explain why there was no prompt platelet increase whereas LDH levels dropped and Hb levels rose quickly). Rituximab may have worked both sided (ITP and TTP) and would explain the platelet rise.CONCLUSION:The ADAMTS13 level of our patient of 11% made the diagnosis of TTP difficult. Moreover, the PEX applications were ineffective in managing her platelet and Hb levels to normal. Therefore, the impact of ADAMTS13 levels and the presence of its inhibitors on overall survival, ultimate clinical outcome, responsiveness to plasma exchange, and relapse in pregnancy-related TTP are still controversial. Therefore, studies assessing this clinical correlation are recommended. We show that rituximab in conjunction with mycophenolate mofetil following PEX was effective in controlling the low platelet count in our patient. Only two doses of rituximab were enough to normalize our patient. We present here a case of safe and effective use of rituximab in pregnancy-induced TTP.;

Mild to moderate hepatic injury is common in exertional heatstroke, while fulminant liver failure is rare. Extrapyramidal symptoms and pulmonary aspergillosis secondary to liver failure induced by exertional heatstroke have never been reported in prior cases.CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old Han Chinese man presented with exertional heatstroke with fulminant liver failure, subsequent pulmonary aspergillosis, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Moreover, he also presented with coma, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. He recovered under conservative treatment including therapeutic plasma exchange plus continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and other support therapy.CONCLUSION: Therapeutic plasma exchange plus continuous veno-venous hemofiltration could be effective for patients with heatstroke who suffer liver failure and other organ failure. Patients with liver failure are at high risk for pulmonary aspergillosis. Movement disorder in these patients might be extrapyramidal symptoms induced by consistent low level of cholinesterase resulted from hepatic injury besides brain injury.;INTRODUCTION: Heatstroke is clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and a history of environmental heat exposure or vigorous physical exertion [1]. Classic heatstroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heatstroke (EHS) is observed in individuals who are highly motivated to perform strenuous physical activity in hot weather [1]. To date, the treatment for heatstroke is aggressive cooling, fluid resuscitation, and other organ support therapy. Despite these efforts, EHS mortality is high and is usually associated with multi-organ failure, especially hepatic injury and coagulopathy [2–4]. However, mild to moderate hepatic injury is common in EHS, while fulminant liver failure has been reported only in about 5 % of patients [5]. Emerging evidence suggests that multi-organ damage is a consequence of direct thermal injury to the tissues, coagulopathies, and development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that is stimulated by endotoxin, cytokines, and other immune modulators. In this report, we describe the case of a 25-year-old man who presented with EHS with fulminant liver failure, subsequent pulmonary aspergillosis, and extrapyramidal symptoms.CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 25-year-old Han Chinese man started feeling dizzy after running 5 km on a rainy night with an ambient temperature of about 30 °C. His surface temperature was 41.2 °C (axillary) and he was taken to a nearby hospital. On presentation at the hospital, he was unconscious, with hyperpyrexia of 40.2 °C, tachycardia of 129 beats/min, and blood pressure of 122/76 mmHg. Orotracheal intubation was performed because of the deterioration of his mental status. His initial blood tests demonstrated elevated transaminases, bilirubin, creatine kinase and creatinine, thrombocytopenia, and deteriorating coagulation. The patient was diagnosed as EHS and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). In spite of cooling, aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood purification, hepatic and renal dysfunction continuously deteriorated. Therefore, the patient was transferred to our critical care medical unit 5 days later (day 5). On admission, our patient was unconscious (no sedation, with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 5) with mechanical ventilation. His temperature was 38.2 °C (axillary), heart rate (HR) was 50 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) was 15/min, and his blood pressure (BP) was 103/70 mmHg (norepinephrine 0.2ug/kg/min). Laboratory data revealed worsened hepatic and renal function, deterioration of coagulation parameters, and markers of infection. A cranial and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormal findings, only the pulmonary CT scan demonstrated little consolidation (Fig. 2a). An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus bradycardia, prolonged QT interval and abnormal ST-T.These biochemical disturbances reflected acute liver failure (ALF). On admission (day 5), the results of his blood biochemistry exhibited high transaminases, 1204.2 U/L alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (normal < 40 U/L), 363.9 U/L aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (normal < 40U/L), significantly elevated total bilirubin (TBIL) 47.0 mg/dL (normal < 1.16 mg/dL), and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 5.65, decreased prothrombin activity (PTA) of 14 % (80 % < normal < 130 %), fibrinogen of 1.16 g/L (2 g/L < normal < 4 g/L) and cholinesterase of 4134U/L (ChE, 4650U/L < normal < 12220U/L) (Fig. 1), and normal blood ammonia of 100.7 μg/dL (27.2 μg/dL < normal < 102 μg/dL). To exclude other causes for ALF, virus serological tests were performed. There were no positive findings for acute or chronic hepatitis A, B, C, E or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Also, acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) was ruled out. The test results for autoimmune antibodies (ASMA, AMA, ANA, ANCA, ENA) were negative. A past history review showed no recent mushroom and herbal products ingestion, and no medication history. Moreover, our patient already met the ALF criteria (TBIL 107.5umol/L and INR 3.1) outside our hospital when his hemodynamic status was stable on day 2, which could rule out hypoxic hepatitis. In addition, an abdominal ultrasound and CT scan did not exhibit evidence of dilated bile ducts and portal embolism. Because of worsening hyperbilirubinemia, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was performed in the subsequent week, even though its role in ALF remained unclear. With the fifth session, it was noted that our patient was more responsive and started to open his eyes spontaneously. His laboratory parameters were also showing an improvement in liver function with resolving coagulopathy (Fig. 1). TPE was discontinued after six sessions and his TBIL decreased from then. It is worth mentioning that his blood ammonia remained normal during the whole process.                                      Fig. 1                      Blood test results, including alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), creatine kinase (CK), and cholinesterase (ChE)Our patient also suffered rhabdomyolysis with a creatine kinase level of 10121U/L (CK, 2U/L < normal < 200U/L) with normal urine output and a mild increase of creatinine because of adequate fluid resuscitation. With the purpose of avoiding rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury and alleviating SIRS, our patient received continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) every day from day 5 to day 10. With the fifth session, it was noted that his CK level (Fig. 1) declined gradually and his creatinine level was normal.Our patient presented persistent fever accompanied with an increase of white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils. On admission, his WBC count was 24,430/μL, N% 88 %, procalcitonin 2.11 ng/ml (normal < 0.5 ng/ml). A sputum culture (day 14) showed Aspergillus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Considering liver failure could dampen host immune function, caspofungin was added. Subsequently, a pulmonary CT scan (day 23) demonstrated emerging nodules with cavity (Fig. 2b). Thus pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed even though the galactomannan (GM) test was negative. A tracheotomy was performed on day 29 not only to favor pulmonary infection control but also to safely use sedative medication due to his undefined movement disorder. With antifungal therapy and recovery of hepatic function, his pulmonary infection improved and a pulmonary CT scan (day 38) demonstrated nodules (Fig. 2c). He was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 34.                                      Fig. 2                      Computed tomography images of lung. a Computed tomography scan on day 4 showing no abnormality. b Computed tomography scan on day 23 showing emerging nodules with cavity. c Computed tomography scan on day 38 showing narrowing nodules. Red arrows, cavityOn day10, sedation was stopped to evaluate mental status. The patient regained eyes open spontaneously but experienced dystonia-like involuntary movements of head and mouth but not extremities. At first, it was diagnosed as seizures secondary to heatstroke related CNS dysfunction. However, we found that promethazine could aggravate involuntary movements while diazepam could temporarily mitigate the symptoms, which indicated that this might not be the case. Electroencephalogram (day 52) showed no abnormal findings and cranial CT (day 4, 33) demonstrated atrophy of frontal lobe (Fig. 3a), temporal lobe (Fig. 3b) and cerebellum (Fig. 3c), which might damage the conduction path of extrapyramidal system. What’s more, liver failure induced consistent low ChE (Fig. 1), probably leading cholinergic and dopaminergic function disorder. Thus, we believed that those involuntary movements were extrapyramidal symptoms. Benzhexol hydrochloride plus scopolamine therapy were initiated (day 53) and diazepam managed to mitigate head and mouth movement disorder even the patient was not sedated. As the recovery of hepatic function and increase of ChE, the dose of benzhexol hydrochloride decreased.                                      Fig. 3                      Computed tomography images of the brain showing atrophy of the temporal and frontal lobe and the cerebellum, comparing the computed tomography scan on day 4 to the computed tomography scan on day 33Finally, at the time of discharge from the ICU (day 93), our patient presented mental retardation, mild extrapyramidal symptoms, and his laboratory tests had returned to normal values except for minor ALT elevation.DISCUSSION: In this case, we described a young patient with severe EHS that was mainly complicated with fulminant liver failure and subsequent pulmonary aspergillosis and extrapyramidal symptoms, as well as coma, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The success in treating this EHS case suggested that therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and CVVH might be effective in EHS cases with fulminant liver failure and other organ failure.Heatstroke is clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature that occurs in the presence of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and a history of environmental heat exposure or vigorous physical exertion [1]. A retrospective study demonstrated that major organ dysfunction involved in heat-related illness included neurological (100 %), renal (57 %), hepatic (34 %), and coagulation abnormalities (26 %) [6]. Approximately 5 % of EHS patients experienced fulminant liver failure, which might be fatal [7]. However, according to Kilian [8] and Garcin [9], acute liver failure (AHF) is relatively frequent during heatstroke and the incidence might be much higher than is usually thought, and hypophosphatemia on admission could predict occurrence of ALF during heatstroke [9]. In this case, TBIL was as high as 57.7 mg/dL (Fig. 1a, day 7) and PT was as high as 52.2 seconds (day 5), which fulfilled accepted London criteria [10] for emergency liver transplantation (PT longer than 50 seconds, bilirubin higher than 17.5 mg/dL, and non-A, non-B hepatitis). The reason that we still chose conservative therapy such as TPE other than orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) was as follows: (1) the pathogenesis of liver failure might be direct thermo-injury to hepatic cells and overwhelming SIRS, which could be conservatively managed and spontaneously recover [5, 11–13], (2) the outcome of liver transplantation in heatstroke in the previous case studies was controversial [14, 15] but the immunosuppressor might have aggravated sepsis-induced organ failure in the mid or late phase in heatstroke [16], (3) the coagulopathy could be improved by transfusion or medication while the blood ammonia levels were as high as 115.3 μg/dL on day 7 (27.2 μg/dL < normal < 102 μg/dL, male). After TPE six times, the TBIL level decreased to 14.97 mg/dL (day 14) and the hepatic function recovered spontaneously.TPE can be used for thrombotic microangiopathy and acute liver failure [17]. To date, only one study was randomized and controlled in patients with ALF to demonstrate a conclusive improvement with conservative therapies [18]. Even whether TPE could treat ALF was controversial, although some case reports have proved that TPE might be effective in EHS with ALF. Raj et al. demonstrated that the addition of therapeutic plasma exchange plus continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) resulted in a reversal of the inflammatory process and recovery from multi-organ failure in an 11-year-old obese boy who suffered EHS with rhabdomyolysis and concurrent renal, pulmonary, and liver failure [13]. Miura et al. also demonstrated that a previously healthy 38-year-old Japanese man who developed EHS following a long-distance run and presented with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) accompanied by a life-threatening flare-up of rhabdomyolysis. Plasma exchange and hemodiafiltration enabled the patient to survive FHF [19]. In our case, like the young man in the former case report [13], our patient finally recovered from ALF, rhabdomyolysis, and concurrent renal and pulmonary failure after TPE and CVVH therapy, which indicated that TPE plus blood purification might be effective in heatstroke with ALF, rhabdomyolysis, and other concurrent organ failure.Encephalopathy is a universal manifestation of heatstroke, occurring abruptly, and can be severe in most of the cases. Commonly, encephalopathy improves dramatically by cooling in 70–90 % of heatstroke patients [20]. Those who did not regain consciousness by cooling or initial therapies always developed seizures or focal motor deficit [20]. The most conspicuous histological damage to the CNS of heatstroke patients includes progressive degeneration of neurons in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex with congestion, edema, and microhemorrhages at autopsy [1]. In this case, a cranial CT scan demonstrated atrophy of the frontal lobe (Fig. 3a), temporal lobe (Fig. 3b), and cerebellum (Fig. 3c), which could explain his mental retardation and extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, benzhexol hydrochloride, a kind of anticholinergic drug, managed to mitigate our patient’s movement disorder, which confirmed the onset of extrapyramidal symptoms. To date, there has been no report on heatstroke-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. Theoretically, consistent low ChE (Fig. 1) might exaggerate cholinergic and dopaminergic function disorder in the context of frontal atrophy. Moreover, as hepatic function recovered and ChE level increased, the dose of benzhexol hydrochloride decreased. Thus, liver failure and decreasing ChE might be involved in extrapyramidal symptoms in this case.SIRS plays an important role in heatstroke pathogenesis as sepsis. In that, early death might be due to overwhelming inflammation while late death might be due to persistent immunosuppression and irreversible infection [21]. Tarek reported a 25-year-old man with heatstroke presenting with severe rhabdomyolysis and massive hepatic necrosis, who died 41 days after the liver transplantation of systemic infection due to fungal and bacterial sepsis [16]. In this regard, prior case reports have documented a high prevalence of Candida spp. infections in heatstroke victims [22]. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a rapid, progressive, fatal disease that occurs mostly in immunocompromised patients. It has been previously demonstrated that patients with decompensated liver disease are more prone to pulmonary aspergillosis [23, 24]. In this case, our patient exhibited high fever, elevated WBC and PCT, aspergillus of sputum culture (day14), and emerging nodes on a pulmonary CT scan (day 23), which indicated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Given the ALF and potential acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis, caspofungin rather than voriconazole or amphotericin B (there was no liposomal amphotericin in our hospital) was chosen as the first-line treatment. Fortunately, caspofungin was able to control the above symptoms and thus was used as monotherapy in this patient with IPA.CONCLUSION:In conclusion, we for the first time report an exertional heatstroke case with liver failure complicated with unexpected extrapyramidal symptoms and pulmonary aspergillosis. Unlike other cases, the movement disorders were induced by consistent low ChE level, which can exaggerate cholinergic and dopaminergic function disorder in the context of frontal atrophy. Thus, as to EHS patients with multiple organ dysfunction characterized by fulminant liver failure, appropriate supportive therapy, such as TPE and CVVH rather than liver transplantation could be justified in the early stage and substantially reduce the mortality and thus was strongly recommended. Anticholinergic drugs, such as benzhexol hydrochloride or scopolamine, could mitigate movement disorders. Further clinical research needs to weigh the risk of fulminant liver failure in EHS.;

We present the case of a woman with autoimmune hemolytic anemia who was diagnosed with parvovirus B19-induced transient aplastic crisis during her second trimester of pregnancy and faced the high risk of both fetal and maternal complications related to this specific viral infection. To the best of our knowledge, the experience of successful intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for B19 virus infection during pregnancy, as in our case, is limited.CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old and 20-week pregnant Chinese woman with genetically confirmed alpha-thalassemia trait was diagnosed with cold antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia and suffered from transient aplastic crisis caused by B19 virus infection. She received intravenous immunoglobulin treatment to reduce the risk of hydrops fetalis. Her peripheral blood reticulocyte percentage recovered, but anemia persisted, so she underwent several courses of high dose intravenous dexamethasone for controlling her underlying hemolytic problem. Finally, her hemoglobin levels remained stable with no need of erythrocyte transfusion, and a healthy baby boy was naturally delivered.CONCLUSION: Parvovirus B19 virus infection should be considered when a sudden exacerbation of anemia occurs in a patient with hemolytic disease, and the possible fetal complications caused by maternal B19 virus infection during pregnancy should not be ignored. Close monitoring and adequate management can keep both mother and fetus safe.;INTRODUCTION: Most parvovirus B19 virus (B19 virus for short in this report) infection causes asymptomatic or only mild illness, such as erythema infectiosum, polyarthropathy syndrome or transient reticulocytopenia in healthy adults or children, but can sometimes be responsible for life-threatening diseases. The cytopathic effect of B19 virus in patients with rapid erythrocytes production results in profuse extinction of proerythroblasts. Failure of differentiation from proerythroblast into later stage erythroid precursors leads to transient aplastic crisis (TAC) [1]. When B19 virus infection occurs during pregnancy, transplacental transmission of B19 virus to the fetus can induce hydrops fetalis or fetal loss due to severe anemia and cardiac failure [2]. Here we report a rare case of severe anemic crisis due to B19 virus infection in a 20-week pregnant woman with alpha-thalassemia trait and possible pregnancy-related cold agglutinin hemolysis.CASE PRESENTATION: This 28-year-old and 20-week pregnant Chinese woman with genetically confirmed alpha-thalassemia trait and a current obstetric record of gravida 3, para 0, artificial abortion 1 and ectopic pregnancy 1 (G3P0AA1E1 by Gravida/para/abortus (GPA) system) presented to our emergency unit (EU) due to headache, chills, fever and general soreness for one day. At our EU, her physical examination revealed a fever up to 38.5°C, mild tachypnea with a respiratory rate up to 21 breaths/min and bilateral lower back knocking pain. Her obstetric ultrasound revealed 20 weeks gestational age, normal placenta location and a fetal heart beat between 140 and 150/min. No vaginal bleeding was noted.Her laboratory data showed pyuria (urine white blood cell count 30 to 50/high power field) and severe peripheral blood pancytopenia: white blood cell (WBC) count 2200/mm3 with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1780/mm3, hemoglobin 5.5g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 119.4fl and platelet count 116,000/mm3. Aggregation of erythrocytes (Figure 1) and low reticulocyte percentage (0.1%) were detected in peripheral blood smear. Both direct and indirect antiglobulin tests were strongly positive for antibodies against erythrocytes. The autoantibody was found to be of the cold type. A subsequent laboratory investigation revealed 1:32(+) of cold hemagglutinin titer, raised lactate dehydrogenase (314U/L) and low levels of complement 3 (55.5mg/dL) and complement 4 (10mg/dL).                                      Figure 1                      Peripheral blood smear. Aggregation of erythrocytes was noted in the peripheral blood smear just before dexamethasone treatment.Her initial bone marrow cytology showed myeloid hyperplasia and only very few erythroid precursors with erythroblasts in abnormal megaloblastic change (Figure 2), some of which presented with pseudopods or ‘dog ears’ (Figure 3), and almost no erythroid maturation beyond basophilic normoblasts. Her bone marrow biopsy revealed scattered erythroblasts displaying homogeneous ground glass intranuclear viral inclusions (Figure 4) and positive nuclear immunostaining of B19 virus (Figure 5). Polymerase chain reaction for B19 virus DNA was positive in specimens from her bone marrow, plasma and nasal cavity. Antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were not checked because she did not present with the symptoms and signs of infectious mononucleosis or lymphoproliferative disorders present in most reported cases of EBV-associated hemolytic anemia.

She received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) injection (CSL Limited, Parkville, Australia), 0.4gm/Kg/day for five days, for eradication of viremia and prophylaxis of occurrence of hydrops fetalis. Although her peripheral blood reticulocyte percentage increased dramatically after IVIG treatment (Figure 6), her hemolytic anemia did not improve much. In order to control her autoimmune hemolysis, intravenous high dose dexamethasone (Astar Chem. & Pharm., Hsinchu, Taiwan), 40mg/day for four days, was prescribed. This treatment was repeated every two weeks for four cycles and then shifted to a monthly oral schedule. She was discharged in a stable condition after the fourth intravenous treatment and received careful follow-up study in our outpatient clinic. No more erythrocytes were transfused after the fifth course of high dose dexamethasone (Figure 7) in spite of persistent mild anemia. During her hospitalization and subsequent outpatient clinic visits, obstetric ultrasound did not reveal any evidence of fetal anemia and hydrops fetalis. Four months later, a normal looking healthy baby boy (Apgar score 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes, body weight 3240gm) was naturally delivered with vacuum extraction aid. After delivery of the baby, her AIHA quickly resolved.                                      Figure 6                      Rapid response of intravenous human immunoglobulin treatment.

The red squares stand for erythrocytes transfusion.DISCUSSION: Whether our patient’s B19 virus in her second trimester pregnancy was a new infection or a reactivation of a persisting previous infection cannot be surely answered, since the persistence of infection in the bone marrow has been reported in immunocompetent individuals several years after primary infection [3]. B19 virus infection causes a five to 10-day cessation of erythrocytic production, but the life span of normal erythrocytes is about 120 days, so B19 virus infection usually is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with self-limited anemia in people without hemolytic diseases [4]. In patients with expanding erythrocyte production caused by the shortened life span of erythrocytes due to an underlying hemolytic problem, such as spherocytosis, sickle cell anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thalassemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, B19 virus infection could induce TAC with severe anemia [2,5]. Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia have also been reported in patients during or after B19 virus infection [2,4,6].Most patients with TAC had a good prognosis after erythrocyte transfusion and adequate monitoring until their bone marrow recovered, while IVIG is recommended for patients at risk of severe complications or with immunodeficiency [2,4,5]. Rapid efficacious reticulocyte recovery and hemoglobin correction after only one IVIG course has also been reported with only a few side effects [7]. Maternally administrated IVIG therapy during pregnancy for improving maternal and fetal outcome in severe B19 virus-induced disorders has also been reported in two cases without obvious complications [8,9]. Weekly fetal ultrasound examination including estimation of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) for timely detection of possible fetal anemia and hydrops fetalis during a post-exposure period of 12 to 20 weeks was highly recommended [10].In our patient, a 20-week pregnant woman with alpha-thalassemia trait and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, B19 virus infection not only caused TAC in the mother, but could also have led to severe anemia, hydrops and even death of the fetus, as cautioned by experts when maternal infection occurred between 17 and 24 weeks of gestation [11]. Therefore we arranged immediate IVIG treatment in addition to erythrocyte transfusion. Our patient responded well to IVIG treatment since her reticulocyte dramatically recovered. However, her anemia due to cold agglutinin disease persisted. So far, only corticosteroids and rituximab (both in pregnancy risk class C) were considered eligible for treating cold agglutinin disease during the third trimester of pregnancy.Although corticosteroid treatment in the first trimester is well-known to increase the risk of fetal orofacial clefts, and the safety of mother and fetus receiving corticosteroids for treating idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in the third trimester of pregnancy, even with high dose intravenous methylprednisolone, was previously confirmed [12], the experience of corticosteroid pulse therapy in the second trimester was limited to the best of our knowledge. However, long term inhibition of neonatal B-lymphocyte development caused by maternal administration of rituximab in the third trimester of pregnancy has been reported [13]. Even though the immune impairment was reversible and no infection-related complications took place according to the literature, our patient refused rituximab injection for fear of damage to the baby. In spite of the generally poor effect of corticosteroid therapy in treating cold antibody AIHA [14], our high dose dexamethasone policy starting in our patient’s second trimester of pregnancy controlled her cold agglutinin disease satisfactorily, without notable side effects, in both the mother and her baby.CONCLUSION:B19 virus infection in a pregnant woman with increased erythropoietic demand from alpha-thalassemia trait and cold AIHA resulted in a TAC in the mother and put the fetus at risk of development of hydrops fetalis. Prompt IVIG injection eradicated the virus rapidly, resolved TAC in the mother and prevented further dangerous fetal infection. Supportive erythrocytes transfusion and intensive high dose dexamethasone treatment maintained hemoglobin at stable levels. Safe delivery of a healthy baby was happily achieved.Both my husband and I felt satisfactorily about the rapid recovery of my hematopoietic function and the safe delivery of a healthy baby boy. We would like to express our great appreciation to our doctors for their efficient and correct diagnosis and prompt management. Although the rather expensive intravenous immunoglobulin was not reimbursed for transient aplastic crisis according to the general health insurance policy in our country and we had to pay for it by ourselves, we thought it was worthwhile since nothing was more important than our health.;
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-015-0678-5;Atypical course in severe catatonic schizophrenia in a cannabis-dependent male adolescent: a case report;;ECT: electroconvulsive therapy, EEG: electroencephalogram, MRI: magnetic resonance imaging, NMS: neuroleptic malignant syndrome, THC: tetrahydrocannabinol;INTRODUCTION: Adolescents with psychoses usually have full recovery from their first psychotic episode, but the first relapse often arises within 2 years of the first episode. Cannabis-related psychoses are difficult to distinguish from schizophrenic psychoses. Here, we describe a particularly severe clinical case, with a first psychotic episode occurring after heavy cannabis smoking, an atypically long symptom-free duration, and a subsequent non-substance-related episode.CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old male adolescent of Middle-East origin presented with delusions and hallucinations after extensive cannabis smoking. His first psychotic episode, with paranoid delusions and hallucinations, progressed into severe catatonic symptoms. His symptoms were treated with electroconvulsive therapy and risperidone and he was transferred to a residential substance abuse treatment center. He remained drug-free and non-psychotic for 3.5 years. Given the temporal association with extensive cannabis use, and his full remission of symptoms lasting several years, a cannabis-induced psychosis—though atypically extended—could be suspected. However, after 3.5 years without psychiatric care, and in a drug-free state, our patient again presented with positive psychotic symptoms, possibly induced by a period of severe psychosocial stress.CONCLUSION: We here discuss whether a primary schizophrenic episode possibly induced by cannabis can increase the risk of subsequent non-drug-related schizophrenic episodes.;INTRODUCTION: Adolescent schizophrenia, in comparison to the adult-onset forms, is associated with an increased family history of schizophrenia, male predominance, more premorbid anomalies in speech, psychomotor, and social development, intelligence below average, insidious onset, fewer systematic delusions and hallucinations [1–3], and more negative symptoms such as flattened affects and bizarre behavior [1]. It can present with enuresis and incontinence during psychosis [4]. The distinction between adolescent schizophrenia and other diagnoses, such as affective psychosis, may be difficult [1]. Adolescents with schizophrenia usually make a full recovery after the first psychotic episode, but after 6 months of psychosis, the prognosis for full recovery is poor [1]. The first relapse often arises within 2 years of the end of the first episode [5–7]. Several potential predictors of relapse have been discussed, including rearing problems in the family, ethnicity, migrant status, urban upbringing [8], treatment discontinuation [7], social adjustment, and poor adaptation to school [6].An acute and usually transient psychosis, including a confusional condition with delusions or hallucinations, has been associated with prolonged cannabis intoxication [9, 10]. Cannabis-related psychoses may be difficult to distinguish from schizophrenic psychoses [11], but may be partly distinguishable [12, 13] by a shorter duration than schizophrenic episodes (typically from hours to a few weeks) and, typically, an onset after intense cannabis smoking. Patients generally remain non-psychotic in the absence of drug relapse [13, 14].Here, we describe a severe clinical case of catatonic schizophrenia in a male adolescent with a history of substantial cannabis smoking, and with an atypically long period of remission between the first and second psychotic episodes. Our aim in presenting this case is to demonstrate the diagnostic challenge in cannabis-induced psychosis vis-à-vis schizophrenia, and to demonstrate the atypical course of a patient with a psychotic disorder but with a particularly long symptom-free period between his first and second psychotic episodes. We also highlight the discussion about whether cannabis might potentially increase the risk of subsequent non-cannabis-related psychotic episodes.CASE PRESENTATION: Six years ago, a 17-year old adolescent male of Middle-East origin was brought to our emergency room at the Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Malmö, Sweden, by his mother and stepfather. Over the previous weeks, he had reported being observed by authorities and criminal gangs. He talked to himself, felt that TV broadcasts referred to his mother, and had aggressive outbursts.Our patient lived with his mother, stepfather, and a 15-year-old brother. He had no family history of psychiatric disease. His psychomotor development had been normal. After his parents’ divorce, our patient moved from a Middle-Eastern country to Sweden with his mother and brother. He started to use illicit drugs before age 13. Contacts with social authorities and a regional addiction center were established.In our emergency room, our patient’s mother reported that he had been smoking cannabis daily for 4 years, up to 3g per day. For the past 2 years, he had also misused tramadol, taking 200–1,000mg daily. He had tried lysergic acid diethylamide, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, ecstasy, inhalants, and different analgesics. For the 3 weeks preceding the emergency room visit, he had abstained from cannabis and tramadol after being enrolled in a youth service program related to a conviction for robbery and cannabis possession. Five days prior to admission, he still screened positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Upon examination, our patient was mute, reacted inappropriately, and presented a depressed mood. A urine toxicology test was negative for THC and other substances. After evaluation, he returned home with a short-term prescription of one antipsychotic medication in a very low dose (levomepromazine, 10mg at night, for 2 consecutive days) and alimemazine (20mg as needed, for 2 days), and with a short-term outpatient appointment.Six days later, still with pronounced ideas of reference, he was voluntarily admitted to the Addiction Centre of our hospital. A urine toxicology test was still negative. After 4 days of inpatient care with persistent delusions, he was transferred to the Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. He reported feelings of being observed by staff and by perceived cameras in street lights, and he laughed without obvious reason. Results from a blood screen, computed tomography of his brain, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. Our patient’s delusions and hallucinations gradually diminished. After 10 days of inpatient care without specific psychopharmacological treatment, he communicated almost adequately and was discharged to a residential addiction treatment center.One week after his arrival at the treatment institution, our patient’s behavior was again altered. He was assessed at the local Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, where he isolated himself, and presented bizarre body postures and inappropriate laughs. A urine toxicology test was negative for THC and other drugs. His arm appeared to be paralyzed and he collected saliva in his mouth. After consultation with pediatric expertise, he was transferred back to the Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry in his hometown, after receiving an intramuscular injection of 10mg of olanzapine.Upon arrival, he was mute and sat completely still, eyes closed, with saliva running down his chin. He also presented with urine and fecal incontinence, and with asymmetric convulsions in his arms and legs. His blood pressure (130/60mmHg) and heart rate (80 beats per minute) were normal. Results of an EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain were normal. A pediatric neurologist did not find signs of physical illness. Possible differential diagnoses included substance-induced psychosis, depressive stupor, catatonic schizophrenia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). A nasogastric tube was introduced for nutrition. He received 20mg of diazepam daily. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was initiated along with risperidone, initially 1mg per day. During the next 5 weeks, he received ECT 12 times with bilateral stimulation. Risperidone was gradually increased to 3mg per day. After the seventh ECT treatment, he opened his eyes and started to communicate with his hands. After the eighth ECT, the nasogastric tube was withdrawn and the diazepam dose was reduced by half. Occasionally he talked about the mafia, laughed inappropriately, and expressed doubts about his medication. After the ninth ECT, the risperidone dose was increased to 4mg per day, and our patient gradually improved. Colleagues from the outpatient Psychosis Team confirmed the preliminary diagnosis of catatonic schizophrenia. Our patient fulfilled diagnostic criteria of catatonic schizophrenia according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10 [15]), including the general schizophrenia criterion (criterion A), at least four out of seven cluster B criteria (criteria number 1, 3, 4, and 5), and the C criterion excluding another factor likely to cause catatonic behavior. Thus, he was diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia (F20.2) and cannabis dependence (F12.2) upon discharge from inpatient treatment, with a prompt appointment with the Psychosis Team.During the first few weeks after discharge, our patient relapsed into tramadol and cannabis abuse. Paranoid delusions and hallucinations re-appeared, and 4 months after discharge he was re-hospitalized. Symptoms improved and he was successfully discharged to another residential addiction treatment institution.Five years ago, having been abstinent from illicit drugs for almost 4 months, our patient started work. The follow-up contact with the Psychosis Team was limited to occasional telephone appointments and finally ceased. Our patient met and moved in with a girlfriend. He started formal training to become a nursing assistant, and maintained good relationships with his girlfriend and friends.Two years ago, our patient started to feel stressed, his girlfriend’s parents expressed doubts about his employment, and he worked and studied at the same time. He started to be absent from classes and suffered from insomnia and weight loss. When his girlfriend traveled, he became suspicious, developed delusions about being poisoned, and changed to vegetarian food. When his girlfriend returned home, he was irritable and expressed ideas of references related to TV broadcasts.Our patient started to spend time with his mother, who reported that he occasionally presented bizarre postures and screamed without reason. On one occasion, he also behaved aggressively towards his mother, and held a knife against his own neck. He was transported by the police to the psychiatric emergency room, where he presented with bizarre facial expressions, inappropriate laughs, paranoid and bizarre delusions, and aggressive and disrupted behavior. Results from a urine toxicology test were negative. He was admitted for compulsory psychiatric treatment, including temporary physical restraint and acute intramuscular treatment with zuclopenthixol. Subsequently, his medication was changed to risperidone in doses increasing to 6mg per day per os. Our patient’s mother was opposed to the medication. After two weeks of inpatient treatment he was discharged in a somewhat improved condition.Owing to anxiety and sleeping problems, our patient returned to the psychiatric emergency unit on several occasions after discharge. He was prescribed levomepromazine without significant effect. One week after discharge, he was brought to hospital after an overdose with a prescribed medication, reportedly levomepromazine. He denied any suicidal intent and his urine toxicology screen was negative. Our patient was again hospitalized for compulsory psychiatric treatment. He was paranoid and dysphoric. Again, his mother was opposed to pharmacological treatment. After 5 days he was discharged with a prescription for risperidone, 25mg weekly, to be administered via the intramuscular route by the Psychosis Team.During the next 4 months, he was seen by a senior consultant at the Psychosis Team on five occasions. Initially he presented with a somewhat dysphoric mood, and inadequate smiles were reported. He was continuously opposed to the medication, and requested a change from injections to oral medication. He started treatment with risperidone, 2mg daily per os. At follow-up, 1 year ago, he reported taking his medication and felt well.DISCUSSION: Our experience with this case illustrates that adolescent schizophrenia can be challenging to classify in individuals with a history of smoking cannabis. The onset was acute with delusions and hallucinations, supporting a cannabis-related or possibly affective psychosis. Owing to the clinical picture, our patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia despite a history of heavy cannabis abuse. A catatonic subtype was determined given the motor immobility, extreme negativism and mutism, and bizarre postures and facial expressions [15]. NMS was ruled out because changes in his level of consciousness, muscular rigidity (bizarre body postures), and autonomic instability (urine incontinence and salivation) began before therapeutic doses of antipsychotic medication were prescribed. The absence of leukocytosis, hyperthermia, and tachycardia along with a normal EEG supports other diagnostic alternatives [16]. After 3.5 years of social adjustment without psychiatric treatment, our patient’s first psychotic episode was more likely to be classified as cannabis-induced, despite the atypically pronounced duration and severity of that first episode [13, 14]. However, after relapsing into pronounced psychotic symptoms without any signs of substance abuse, he was re-diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia.The temporal association of our patient’s first psychotic episode with heavy cannabis use clearly raises questions about a potential role of cannabis in psychotic disorders. There is a relatively large amount of literature describing the association between cannabis and acute and chronic psychosis [9–14, 17–19]. Here, the onset of our patient’s psychosis was acute rather than insidious, typically suggesting a cannabis-induced psychosis rather than schizophrenia, and although results of his urine toxicology had returned to normal after 3 weeks of social authority supervision, the temporal association with heavy cannabis consumption was confirmed by our patient’s family.The acute onset with positive symptoms, along with a nearly full remission after 10 days of inpatient care, could have pointed towards an affective psychosis [4]. However, our patient presented no signs of elevated mood. Depressive stupor was considered, our patient presented with depressive symptoms, possibly mood-congruent delusions, and he was clearly improved by ECT, but severe psychotic symptoms including motor and vegetative symptoms clearly dominated the clinical picture, and an affective diagnosis was rejected in favor of catatonic schizophrenia [20, 21]. Normal blood test results, an MRI of his brain, an EEG, and consultation with pediatric expertise ruled out neurodegenerative psychosis. Thus, after an initial interpretation of the symptoms as manifestations of a cannabis-induced psychosis, a primary catatonic schizophrenia appeared a considerably more likely explanation. While an entirely substance-related etiology was ruled out, we cannot exclude that cannabis played a significant role in the onset of the first episode, and that it may even have predisposed our patient to a subsequent psychotic episode, potentially precipitated by a stressful situation. Although the literature is not conclusive in this area, it cannot be ruled out that heavy cannabis abuse can be a predictor of later psychosis [18].Our experience in this case suggests that adolescent schizophrenic episodes in the same patient may potentially be elicited by different stressors, for example, cannabis smoking [17–19] and psychological stress [22, 23], and cause almost the same clinical presentation. This case illustrates the potential role of proximal risk factors for the development of schizophrenic episodes [17–19, 22, 23]. Our patient had no known heredity predisposition for schizophrenia, but was vulnerable in other aspects, including stressful life events. He was brought up in a war-torn country, his parents were divorced, and he became a migrant with an urban up-bringing at the age of 12 years. Soon after arriving in Sweden he became socially marginalized and failed academically. It cannot be excluded that these circumstances, together with heavy cannabis smoking, contributed to his illness [8, 17, 18].An asymptomatic duration of 3.5 years of social adjustment, without medication and psychiatric services, is uncommon after the first severe schizophrenic episode [5–7], making the clinical course of the present case unusual. Continued contact with the Psychosis Team probably would have reduced the risk for relapse [1, 23]. The change from a hazardous lifestyle with heavy cannabis smoking to a drug-free state with social adaption was not enough for our patient to maintain health. With increased social adjustment, our patient might have experienced a feeling of false safety, making him end the outpatient contact with the Psychosis Team. This case emphasizes the importance of educating a patient and their parents, especially in cases where there is hesitation about treatment, because compliance is likely to be fundamental in the control of symptoms [1, 24]. Our patient’s mother was critical to the pharmacological treatment, and this may have contributed to the short treatment period and re-hospitalization one week after discharge [25]. Pharmacological treatment is crucial for recovery [7], and more psycho-educational efforts could have been made in the communication with our patient and his parents, and potentially could have improved compliance with treatment [1]. Finally, this case demonstrates the importance of maintaining at least a sparse outpatient contact after a first psychotic episode, although this may be challenging in patients who are currently not presenting subjective symptoms of disease [1, 6, 24].CONCLUSION:Our experience with this case illustrates that adolescent schizophrenia can be challenging to classify in individuals with a history of smoking cannabis.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-017-1500-3;Breast metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: a case report;;BM: Breast metastasis, UEQ: Upper external quadrant;INTRODUCTION: Breast metastases from extramammary tumors are extremely rare, the most common primary tumors being contralateral breast carcinoma, followed by lung, gynecological, gastrointestinal, melanoma, and hematological cancers. Only a few cases deriving from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in the literature to date.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to our hospital with a solitary breast lesion in the right upper external quadrant associated with multiple bone and visceral metastases. Two years before, she had undergone radical resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (stage pT2, pN1), which was followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Breast ultrasound showed a hypoechogenic tumor lesion of 4 cm in the right upper external quadrant that was associated with multiple axillary and infra-/supraclavicular adenopathies. A positron emission tomographic scan documented multiple visceral and bone metastases with a single hypermetabolic lesion of the right breast. The results of histology and immunohistochemistry were consistent with a metastasis from a squamous cell carcinoma. The patient died of acute respiratory insufficiency 1 month after her breast metastasis diagnosis and before starting any systemic antitumoral treatment.CONCLUSION: Although breast metastases are extremely rare, they should be considered in any patient with a history of cancer and confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry because they are very difficult to distinguish from other primary breast tumors based only on clinical and radiological features. There are no standardized treatment guidelines for breast metastasis management. Surgery and radiotherapy can play a role in symptom palliation, but they do not have any relevant impact on survival, the prognosis being poor, with an estimated overall survival less than 1 year from diagnosis.;INTRODUCTION: Breast metastases (BMs) from extramammary tumors are extremely rare [1–6]. Frequencies of 0.5% and 6.6% have been reported in clinical and autopsy studies, respectively, the most common primary tumors being contralateral breast carcinoma followed by lung, gynecological, gastrointestinal, melanoma, and hematological cancers [1–6].BMs are very difficult to distinguish clinically and radiologically from primary, benign or malignant breast lesions [6–9]. Histological and immunohistochemical studies are necessary for an accurate pathologic diagnosis [10–12]. BM treatment is extremely complex and depends on multiple factors, such as histology, the patient’s clinical condition and comorbidities, the presence of concomitant extramammary metastases, lymph node status, and the interval from primary tumor diagnosis [6–8].Because BM is usually indicative of disseminated disease, its prognosis is poor, with an estimated overall survival less than 1 year from diagnosis [6–8]. BM from squamous cell head and neck carcinoma is very uncommon, with only a few cases reported in the literature to date [13, 14]. In our case, tumor relapse was clinically aggressive and led to patient's death 1 month after BM diagnosis, before starting any antitumoral treatment.CASE PRESENTATION: In May 2016, a 47-year-old Caucasian woman was hospitalized for pain in the left knee resistant to common analgesics. She presented with a past history of epilepsy and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was a hairdresser, and she smoked more than 20 cigarettes/day. She was married, and she had three healthy children. She had no family history of malignancy. She did not take any particular medication regularly. In 2014, she had undergone radical resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (stage pT2, pN1), then received adjuvant radiotherapy. Her follow-up was uneventful until April 2016, when multiple bone metastases from a squamous cell carcinoma were histologically confirmed.The patient’s oxygen saturation on admission was 96%, and her blood pressure and heart rate were normal at 124/82 mmHg and 95 beats/minute, respectively. Her oral temperature was 36.8 °C. The result of her physical examination was normal except for a bulky, painful lesion of the left knee and a solitary, painless, intramammary lesion of 4 cm in the right upper external quadrant (UEQ), without any skin retraction, associated with multiple fixed right axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.The patient’s pH was 7.43, her partial pressure of arterial oxygen was 72 mmHg, and her partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide was 36 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed normocytic normochromic anemia (8.6 g/dl), hypoalbuminemia (26 g/dl), and severe hypercalcemia (3.31 mmol/L, ionized calcium 1.99 mmol/L). The patient’s renal and hepatic function was normal.Whole-body computed tomography revealed multiple lymph node, peritoneal, splenic, lung, and bone metastases, as well as a solitary breast lesion in the right UEQ (Fig. 1a). A positron emission tomographic scan documented multiple visceral lymph nodes and bone metastases with a single hypermetabolic lesion of the right breast (Fig. 1b). Breast ultrasound confirmed the presence of a hypoechogenic tumor lesion of 4 cm in the UEQ that was associated with multiple axillary and infra-/supraclavicular adenopathies (Fig. 1c).                                      Fig. 1                                                          a Chest computed tomographic scan showing an irregular tumoral lesion of the right breast (circled red arrow). b Positron emission tomographic scan showing a hypermetabolic intramammary lesion with central necrosis (circled red arrow) associated with multiple mediastinal hypermetabolic lymph nodes (yellow arrows). c Breast ultrasound showing a hypoechogenic tumor lesion of 4-cm diameter in the upper external quadrant of the right breast without any spiculation. d Histological specimen (hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, original magnification ×40) showing breast parenchyma massively infiltrated by medium-sized tumor cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and an anisokaryotic and hyperchromatic nucleus. The signs of mitosis are moderately frequent. Tumor cells are arranged in massifs or compact and, more rarely, cribriform spans within an abundant fibroinflammatory stroma. Focal areas of Malpighian inflection are observable without any in situ component. e Immunohistochemistry revealing tumor cells that are negative for estrogenic hormone receptors in contrast with normal canal breast cells, which regularly express these receptors (yellow arrow)A percutaneous echo-guided biopsy of the breast lesion was performed. Histology revealed well- to moderately differentiated squamous tumor cells infiltrating the breast tissue without any in situ ductal or lobular component or desmoplastic reaction (Fig. 1d). Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were positive for anti-p40 and anti-p63 and negative for cytokeratins 7 and 20, hormone receptors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, confirming the diagnosis of a BM from a squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 1e).Analgesic palliative radiotherapy was performed at the tibial bone metastasis. The patient’s hypercalcemia normalized after intravenous hydration and zoledronic acid administration. Her anemia was treated with a blood transfusion of 2 U of red cell concentrate. Considering the quick worsening of the patient’s clinical condition, best supportive care was initiated, and the patient died of acute respiratory insufficiency in June 2016 before any systemic antitumoral treatment was started.DISCUSSION: We report a case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to our hospital with a solitary BM in the context of multiple tumor diffusion of a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx radically treated 2 years before with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Compared with other cases reported in the literature, in our patient, tumor relapse showed very aggressive clinical behavior, leading to the patient’s death 1 month after BM diagnosis and before any antitumoral treatment was started.BMs from extramammary tumors are extremely rare, the most common primary tumors being contralateral breast carcinoma followed by lung, gynecological, gastrointestinal, melanoma, and hematological cancers [1–6]. BMs are more common in women (92.2%), in the left breast (46%), and in the UEQ. They are bilateral in only 13.7% of cases [1–6].The mean age at diagnosis is 50 years (range 32–87 years). BMs are often metachronous, and they appear, on average, 30 months after diagnosis of the primary extramammary malignancy. BM is the first sign of the primary extramammary tumor in 51% of cases [1–6].Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain BM physiopathogenesis, the two most popular being the “seed and soil” theory and breast vascularization that is more important in the UEQ, supporting clinical and epidemiological evidence of the high BM frequency in this site [6].Clinically, BMs present as round, rapidly growing, painless, and mobile masses, without any skin dimpling, nipple retraction, or bloody nipple discharge owing to their extraductal development [1–6]. On mammograms, BMs typically appear as well-circumscribed lesions without spiculations, thickening of the skin, or peritumoral stromal reaction, but they can be mistaken for benign (fibroadenoma) as well as primary breast malignancies [1–6]. Microcalcifications are unusual, and they have been reported in only a few cases of ovarian carcinoma with psammoma bodies [6–9]. At the ultrasound examination, hypoechogenic nodules with indistinct and irregular margins are often seen with or without penetrating vascularity, this latter being very suggestive of malignancy [6–9].In a recent review, typical ultrasound features of BMs included single or multiple round to oval-shaped, well-circumscribed hypoechogenic masses without spiculations, calcifications, or architectural distortion [6–9]. However, lesions show variable radiological features in some cases, and the possibility of a BM should be suspected for a breast tumor in a patient with a history of cancer, even if clinically or radiologically benign [6–9].Because it is very difficult to distinguish BMs clinically and radiologically from other primary breast tumors, histology plays a pivotal role in accurate diagnosis, which is essential to tailor an appropriate treatment [6–8]. Core percutaneous biopsy is comparatively better than fine-needle aspiration biopsy because histology and immunohistochemistry are often necessary for a differential diagnosis [9–12].Histologically, BMs show a periductal and perilobular location, lack of any in situ ductal or lobular component, absence of a desmoplastic reaction and elastosis due to their fast growth, a sharp transition at the border of the tumor, and the presence of subcutaneous tissue infiltration [6, 9–12]. Also, because most primary breast carcinomas originate in the ducts or lobules of the breast, the finding of in situ (intraductal) carcinoma is more supportive of a primary breast tumor [9–12]. However, when a well-circumscribed breast tumoral lesion is identified showing lack of in situ components, the possibility of a BM should be considered and excluded, especially in high-grade and hormone receptor-negative tumors [9–12].In a recent retrospective analysis by Buisman et al., the diagnosis had to be corrected postoperatively in four patients (9%), supporting the point that BM diagnosis can be very difficult not only because clinical presentation may be similar to primary breast malignancies but also because it may be the first presentation of an unknown metastatic disease [9]. In addition, the diagnosis is hard to make on the basis of cytology alone. Obviously, proper clinical information may be helpful and should be provided to the pathologist.Management of BM patients is extremely complex and depends on multiple factors, such as the patient’s clinical condition and comorbidities, the presence of concomitant extramammary metastases, histology, lymph node status, and the interval from primary tumor diagnosis [6]. Because BMs are usually associated with other concomitant extramammary metastases, supporting the evidence of an aggressive disseminated disease, surgery is indicated only for symptom palliation, such as in cases of local disease involving the skin, areola, or nipple [1–6] or when an isolated, metachronous BM is seen with a long interval from the primary tumor diagnosis. A simple mastectomy may be the treatment of choice in cases of large, ulcerated, or deep lesions causing severe pain or hemorrhage [1–6].Instead, systemic therapy is required for most of these patients [1–6]. Using a combination of local therapy with systemic chemotherapy may also be considered if the patient has ulceration of the breast mass or invasion of the chest wall, as well as disseminated metastases [1–6]. The prognosis for patients with BMs is very poor, with an estimated overall survival less than 1 year from diagnosis [1–6].CONCLUSION:Our patient presented with an isolated BM deriving from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx treated 2 years before in the context of a disseminated and very aggressive disease that did not allow any antitumoral treatment. BM is rare and often clinically and radiologically misdiagnosed. It should be considered in any patient with a cancer history and confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry. BM treatment has to be carefully tailored, taking multiple clinical and tumoral factors into consideration. The particularity of this case relies on the rarity of BM arising from squamous cell head and neck carcinoma, with only a few cases reported in the literature to date, as well as on the very aggressive clinical behavior of the disease, leading to the patient’s death 1 month after her BM diagnosis and before any systemic treatment was started.;

These symptoms and signs disappeared a few days after discontinuation of clozapine. At present, we are not aware of reports of clozapine–antifungals interaction, whereas there is only one other case report on the interaction between oral contraceptives and clozapine. The purpose of this case report is to show the risk of potentially serious adverse effects stemming from drug interactions involving medications routinely used in clinical practice.CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old Caucasian woman diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder was admitted to a psychiatric unit for acute psychosis (hallucinations, delusions and catatonic behavior). She denied smoking tobacco products and was on long-term oral contraceptives. During the first month of hospitalization she was treated with antipsychotics and for 1 week she took simultaneously fluconazole and miconazole gel, after being diagnosed with oral candidiasis. On the last day of antifungals treatment, 29 days after admission, clozapine was started with resolution of psychotic symptoms. After 3 weeks, her clozapine plasma level had increased to 542ng/mL and eosinophilia was observed. She complained of nausea, vomiting and palpitations, echocardiography showed echocardiographic abnormalities and pericardial effusion. Oral contraceptives were discontinued and after 1 week clozapine was interrupted, with a complete resolution of side effects and pericardial effusion within 4 days.CONCLUSION: Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450. The use of inhibitors or other substrates of cytochrome P450, such as antifungals and oral contraceptives, can cause long-lasting interactions and clozapine toxicity. The Naranjo algorithm shows clozapine is a definite cause of pericarditis (score 9) and both clozapine–antifungals and clozapine–contraceptives interactions resulted probable (score 5) in Drug Interaction Probability Scale. A good knowledge on drugs that act as substrates, inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 is mandatory. When those drugs are used in patients taking clozapine, blood level monitoring of clozapine should be recommended, since a lower dose of clozapine might be required to prevent clozapine toxicity.;INTRODUCTION: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic, known for life-threatening side effects, such as agranulocytosis and cardiac complications, but also for its role in the treatment of resistant psychoses when other therapies have failed [1].The most serious cardiac complications caused by clozapine, such as cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and pericarditis, are characterized by shortness of breath, heart palpitations/pains and thoracic pain. In most cases, electrocardiographic changes, pericardial effusion, and nonspecific signs of inflammation are observed. However, only a few cases of pericarditis and pericardial effusion induced by clozapine, even when used at low dosage, are reported in the literature [2].A review by Wehmeier et al. reported 65 cases of myocarditis, 52 cases of cardiomyopathy and only six cases of pericarditis occurring during clozapine treatment [3]. The dose used is a poor predictor of clinical response, and there is little correlation between dose and plasma level, due to individual differences in metabolism, pharmacokinetic differences, gender, age, drug interactions and the smoking of tobacco products.Antifungal drugs, including fluconazole and miconazole, are widely used in the treatment of systemic candidal infections and mycoses. Multiple drug therapy is a common therapeutic practice and many drug–drug interactions involving metabolic inhibition are reported in the literature. Clozapine is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) microsomal system. The contribution of these isoenzymes to clozapine metabolism differs between individuals, leading to the wide inter-patient variability found in clozapine plasma concentration. The drug is converted to norclozapine by CYP3A4 and 1A2 and to clozapine N-oxide by CYP3A4 [4,5]. However, CYP2C19 is also important at clozapine therapeutic concentration (24%) whereas the contributions of CYP2C9 (12%) and 2D6 (6%) are more modest. CYP1A2 is the most important form at therapeutic concentration (30%), while CYP3A4 plays a more important role at a high concentration (37%) than at therapeutic concentration (22%) [6].The use of inhibitors or other substrates of P450, such as oral contraceptive (OCs) and antifungals, can cause unfavorable and long-lasting interactions and clozapine toxicity: in vitro, miconazole and ketoconazole may cause an inhibition of more than 50% of clozapine metabolism [7].It has been reported that fluconazole and miconazole competitively inhibit CYP3A4 activities.In particular, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 are more strongly inhibited by miconazole than fluconazole [8], and this inhibition may last several days, due to antifungals long half-life and wash-out, allowing clozapine accumulation and toxicity. In this way, miconazole and fluconazole may inhibit clozapine metabolism determining an increase and/or prolongation of both therapeutic and adverse effects. At present, we are not aware of reports of clozapine–antifungals interaction, however, drug–drug interactions involving other classes of antipsychotics and antifungals are reported in the literature [9], whereas there is only one other case report on the interaction between OCs and clozapine [10]. The purpose of this case report is to show the risk of potentially serious adverse effects stemming from drug interactions involving medications routinely used in clinical practice. Learning how to predict and monitor drug–drug interactions may help reduce the incidence of clinically significant adverse drug events.CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old Caucasian woman affected by a schizoaffective disorder, treated with haloperidol 2mg per day and olanzapine 10mg per day, was admitted at a Psychiatric Unit for a reacutization of her psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions and catatonic behavior), due to a lack of medications adherence. Her past medical history was characterized by a previous hospitalization for acute psychosis 1 year earlier, incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ovarian cysts. Her family medical history revealed that her mother had an anxiety disorder and her grandmother had a major depression. She was on long-term OCs, ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone 0.03mg/3mg per day and denied smoking tobacco products and any substance use.A physical examination showed a temperature of 37.2°C and blood pressure of 150/100mmHg, whereas all the other parameters were within normal range. The results of blood tests and electrocardiography (ECG) were normal, except for RBBB. Her hospitalization lasted 3 months and during the first month she was treated orally with olanzapine 20mg per day and haloperidol 9mg per day for 23 days. On the 23rd day of hospitalization, since a poor response to treatment was observed, antipsychotics were interrupted and aripiprazole 30mg per day was administered for 6 days. In addition, on the same day, she was diagnosed with oral candidiasis and treated simultaneously for a week orally with fluconazole 100mg per day and miconazole oral gel 2% 20mg, two times per day. Since her psychotic symptoms did not seem to improve, 29 days after admission and on the last day of antifungal treatment, aripiprazole was replaced by clozapine.Clozapine was started at 25mg per day orally and was gradually increased, within 16 days, to 225mg per day with the resolution of psychotic symptoms. After 3 weeks the plasma level of clozapine was 542ng/mL (range 350 to 450ng/mL) and the level of its active metabolite norclozapine was 216ng/mL. Blood tests showed eosinophilia and an increase of C-reactive protein (5.73mg/L). She experienced the first symptoms (nausea, vomiting, palpitations) 5 days before the plasma level of clozapine was measured, while she was being treated with clozapine and OCs. At that point, long-term OCs treatment was discontinued and no other form of contraception was administered to her. She was referred to a cardiologist.A physical examination showed tachycardia and gallop rhythm and she complained of nausea and vomiting. An ECG revealed sinus tachycardia (135 beats/minute), QTc 0.43 seconds, and S-T segment depression and inversion of T-waves in inferior and lateral leads. An echocardiography showed a small pericardial effusion suggestive of iatrogenic pericarditis.Due to those findings, 1 week after discontinuing OCs, clozapine was also interrupted and she was not rechallenged. Within 4 days, she showed resolution of clozapine side effects, normalization of ECG and complete recovery of pericardial effusion. Her symptoms continued to improve and 6 days after discontinuing clozapine she was discharged. The plasma level of clozapine, measured 1 week after discontinuing clozapine (2 weeks after interruption of OCs) was undetectable. At 1 month follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography and inflammatory markers were normal (Figure 1).                                      Figure 1                      Clinical case timeline. The figure reports the most important clinical aspects, interventions, diagnosis and follow up with the outcomes. Abbreviations: ECG, electrocardiography, min, minutes, OCs, oral contraceptives.DISCUSSION: We report the case of a multiple drug interaction involving clozapine, OCs and antifungals, which resulted in an increased clozapine plasma level, pericarditis and eosinophilia. Although clozapine toxicity is usually linked with clozapine serum levels higher than 1000ng/mL, at the moment there is no evidence of a clear toxicity range in the literature [11] and we cannot exclude that the patient might have experienced an adverse reaction at a lower serum level of clozapine (542ng/mL). Pericarditis is an insidious disease which may debut with nonspecific symptoms, therefore a high level of diagnostic suspicion is always needed when clozapine is being used. In this case, the most common causes of pericardial illness were ruled out with the possible exception of a viral pericarditis, since cardiac symptoms began 1 month after clozapine was started, quickly resolved after discontinuation and did not return again. Clozapine-induced myocarditis was also excluded since echocardiography, cardiac necrosis markers and brain natriuretic peptide were all negative.Clozapine was a definite causative agent (score of 9) according to the Naranjo probability scale [12], which evaluates single-drug adverse events, and according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS) [13], a probable causative agent, since both clozapine–antifungals and clozapine–OCs interactions scored 5.The ranking differences between these two assessment tools involve the questions used in DIPS to evaluate drug–drug interactions, in multiple drug interactions DIPS is the most accurate tool. A positive rechallenge with the precipitant drug is a strong indicator of causation. Unfortunately, the patient was not rechallenged with clozapine, and previous plasma levels of the drug were not measured, so we are not able to rule out the presence of clozapine toxicity prior to the first measurement.At present, we are not aware of reports of clozapine–antifungals interaction, but drug–drug interactions involving other classes of antipsychotics and antifungals are reported in the literature [9]. 17α-Ethinyl estradiol (EE) is a CYP3A4 substrate and an inhibitor of CYP1A1 in vitro, moreover, there is evidence of a time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 by OCs [14]. Drospirenone is partially metabolized by CYP3A4 and is also an inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CY2C9. Therefore, both OCs’ components can inhibit different CYPs, although at higher clozapine concentrations CYP3A4 is the most active, thus the greater inhibition is more probably determined by EE.There is less information about the effect of OCs on other drugs, but clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are known to occur. A possible OCs–clozapine interaction mechanism could be a competitive enzyme inhibition, as both drugs are partially metabolized by CYP3A4, and OCs are considered mild inhibitors of CYP3A4. Moreover, several studies have shown that OCs impair the metabolism of CYP1A2 substrates in vivo [15], which might represent another possible mechanism (Table 1).Table 1                                              Drugs’ metabolism                                          MedicationMetabolismInducersInhibitors                            Clozapine                          CYP1A2, 3A4, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6––                            Fluconazole                          Hepatic–CYP3A4, 2C9                            Miconazole                          Hepatic–CYP3A4, 2C9, 2C19, 1A2                            Ethinyl estradiol                          CYP3A4, 1A2–CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C19, 3A4                            Drospirenone                          CYP3A4–CYP1A1, 2C9, 2C19To the best of our knowledge, there is only one report of a possible drug interaction between clozapine (at a dose of 550mg per day) and OCs, in a 47-year-old woman who was a heavy smoker of tobacco products, resulting in elevated clozapine plasma levels (736, 770, and 792ng/mL) and onset of adverse effects, after which OCs treatment was discontinued. Side effects disappeared within a few days and normalization of clozapine blood levels was observed over the next 6 weeks [10].Finally, the inhibition of CYPs is compatible with the pharmacokinetics of antifungals and OCs, allowing the elevation of clozapine plasma levels which occurred 2 weeks after antifungals interruption. Miconazole and fluconazole half-life and wash-out are 24 hours and 10 days, and 28 hours and 12 days, respectively. In this case, we must take into account not only the single antifungals–clozapine interaction but also the contribution of OCs (half-life 20 hours, wash-out 8 days) which might have impaired CYPs metabolism for 26 days, while the patient was simultaneously treated with clozapine (Figure 2). Since OCs were administered for a longer time, compared to antifungals, we think that they might have contributed more significantly to the increase of the blood concentration of clozapine.                                      Figure 2                      Drugs’ interaction timeline and pharmacokinetics. The figure reports the four drugs administered to the patient at the same time (ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone, clozapine, fluconazole, miconazole) and the onset and duration of the adverse drug reactions. The peak of clozapine plasma level (542ng/mL) was observed after 18 days. Adverse drug reactions were observed 2 days after clozapine peak and lasted 14 days. Abbreviation: ADRs, adverse drug reactions.CONCLUSION:To conclude, this report suggests a possible multiple drug interaction between clozapine, antifungals and OCs, which resulted in an elevated clozapine blood level, eosinophilia and pericarditis with pericardial effusion.Based on the case report described here, we can make the following recommendations:1.                      In patients taking clozapine, detecting ECG and echocardiography abnormalities is highly recommended, and clozapine must be stopped if patients develop pericardial involvement.                     2.                      Blood level monitoring of clozapine is essential when inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, such as antifungals or OCs, are being used, since a lower dose of clozapine might be required to prevent adverse effects.                     3.                      A good knowledge of drugs that act as substrates, inhibitors or inducers of P450 is essential for doctors to take appropriate cautions, and a close monitoring for potential drug interactions when using drugs with a narrow therapeutic range such as clozapine is always recommendable.In patients taking clozapine, detecting ECG and echocardiography abnormalities is highly recommended, and clozapine must be stopped if patients develop pericardial involvement.Blood level monitoring of clozapine is essential when inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, such as antifungals or OCs, are being used, since a lower dose of clozapine might be required to prevent adverse effects.A good knowledge of drugs that act as substrates, inhibitors or inducers of P450 is essential for doctors to take appropriate cautions, and a close monitoring for potential drug interactions when using drugs with a narrow therapeutic range such as clozapine is always recommendable.;
